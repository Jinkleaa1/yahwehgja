Judaism in its Own Words –

Who is Human? Who is Not?


"You are Adam ["man"], but goyim [gentiles] are not called Adam ["man"]." Kerithoth 6b

"The seed of the goyim is like an animal." Sanhedrin 74b

"All Gentile children are animals." Yebamoth 98a 

"The best of the gentiles: kill him; the best of snakes: smash its skull; the best of women: is filled with witchcraft." Kiddushin 66c The uncensored version of this text appears in Tractate Soferim (New York, M. Higer, 1937), 15:7, p. 282. "The best of the gentiles should all be killed" (http://talmudical.blogspot.com). From the original Hebrew of the Babylonian Talmud as quoted by the 1907 Jewish Encyclopedia published by Funk and Wagnalls and compiled by Isidore Singer, under the entry, 'Gentile,' (p. 617). 

The Complete Guide to Killing Non-Jews (Ma'ariv 09.11.09 (p. 2) by Roi Sharon) http://www.nrg.co.il. Here is a full translation of the article in the Maariv newspaper of Israel didiremez.wordpress.com 

Rabbi Eliyahu exhorts the killing of women and children: jpost.com 

Rabbis Yitzhak Ginzburg and Yaakov Yosef endorse Rabbi Yitzhak Shapiro's 2009 book endorsing the killing of babies and children, adding "It is permissable to kill the Righteous among Nations even if they are not responsible for [threatening Israel]. If we kill a Gentile who has sinned or has violated one of the seven commandments—because we care about the commandments—there is nothing wrong with the murder"  (haaretz.com). 

"Who is funding the rabbis who endorse killing Gentile babies?" By Akiva Eldar, Ha'aretz, 11/17/09 
". . . For example, [Israel's] government ministries regularly transfer support and funding to a yeshiva whose rabbi determined that it is permissible to kill gentile babies "because their presence assists murder, and there is reason to harm children if it is clear that they will grow up to harm us . . . it is permissible to harm the children of a leader in order to stop him from acting evilly . . . we have seen in the Halakha that even babies of gentiles who do not violate the seven Noahide laws, there is cause to kill them because of the future threat that will be caused if they are raised to be wicked people like their parents. . ." (haaretz.com). 

". . . 'living soul' designates Israel because they are children of the Almighty, and their souls, which are holy, come from Him. From whence come the souls of other peoples? R[abbi] Eleazar said: 'They obtain souls from those sides of the left which convey impurity, and therefore they are all impure and defile those who have contact with them.'. . .'living soul' refers to Israel, who have holy living souls from above, and 'cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth,' to the other peoples who are not 'living soul," but who are as we have said." Bereshith 47a 

"Gentile souls are of a completely different and inferior order. They are totally evil, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever . . . their material abundance derives from supernal refuse. Indeed, they themselves derive from refuse, which is why they are more numerous than the Jews. . ." Abraham Foxbrunner. Habad: The Hasidism of Schneur Zalman of Lyady. Northvale NJ: Jason Aronson Inc., 1983. p. 108-109. 

Rabbinic Text or Call to Terror? By Daniel Estrin, Published January 20, 2010, issue of January 29, 2010.
JERUSALEM—The marble-patterned, hardcover book embossed with gold Hebrew letters looks like any other religious commentary you'd find in an Orthodox Judaica bookstore—but reads like a rabbinic instruction manual outlining acceptable scenarios for killing non-Jewish babies, children and adults. 

"The prohibition 'Thou Shalt Not Murder'" applies only "to a Jew who kills a Jew," write Rabbis Yitzhak Shapira and Yosef Elitzur of the West Bank settlement of Yitzhar. Non-Jews are "uncompassionate by nature" and attacks on them "curb their evil inclination," while babies and children of Israel's enemies may be killed since "it is clear that they will grow to harm us" (forward.com). 

"One million Arabs are not worth a Jewish fingernail." Rabbi Yaacov Perrin, Feb. 27, 1994 [N.Y. Times, February 28, 1994, p. 1] at the eulogy for Dr. Baruch Goldstein, Kach Party terrorist who used a machine gun to murder at least 39 Palestinians worshipping at Cave of the Patriarchs mosque in Hebron. Rabbis praised his mass murder and then Prime Minister Yitshak Rabin gave permission for a memorial to honor Goldstein. Here's a picture of the shrine to the mass murderer. 

"The Jew by his source and in his very essence is entirely good. The goy, by his source and his very essence, is completely evil. This is not simply a matter of religious distinction, but rather of two completely different species." Rabbi Saadya Grama, Romemut Yisrael Ufarashat Hagalut ("Jewish Superiority and the Question of Exile") 2003. 

"Souls of non-Jews come entirely from the female part of the Satanic sphere. For this reason souls of non-Jews are called evil." [Yesaiah Tishbi, Torat ha-Rave-ha-Kelippahnbe-Kabbalat ha-Ari (The Theory of Evil and the Satanic Sphere in Kabbalah) 1942, reprinted 1982] The Messianic age of restoration and redemption (tikkun olam) forecast by the religion of Judaism and spoon-fed to their partisans among the goyim, posits a world restored to universal harmony and justice. That's the cover story, anyway. But the truth is it is somewhat more macabre, as Tishby relates: ". . . the presence of Israel among the nations mends the world, but not the nations of the world . . . . It does not bring the nations closer to holiness, but rather it extracts the holiness from them and thereby destroys their ability to exist . . . [T]he purpose of the full redemption is to destroy the vitality of all the peoples"], Michael Hoffman, Judaism Discovered: A Study of the Anti-Biblical Religion of Racism, Self-Worship, Superstition, and Deceit, ISBN 13: 9780970378453, p.774-775 

"Even when we seek revenge, it is important to make one thing clear—the life of one yeshiva boy is worth more than the lives of 1,000 Arabs. The Talmud states that if gentiles rob Israel of silver they will pay it back in gold, and all that is taken will be paid back in folds, but in cases like these there is nothing to pay back, since as I said—the life of one yeshiva boy is worth more than the lives of 1,000 Arabs" ("Rabbi Eliyahu: Life of one yeshiva boy worth more than 1,000 Arabs," Kobi Nahshoni, Ynet, April 3, 2008, ynetnews.com). 

Because Gentiles are not human, Gentiles are owed no debt of morality or decency—not honesty [Baba Kamma 113a], not property [Baba Mezia 24a], not even life!—"The best of the Gentiles should all be killed" Soferim 15, 10. 

"Some of the Turks and the nomads in the North, and the Blacks and the nomads in the South, and those who resemble them in our climates. And their nature is like the nature of mute animals, and according to my opinion they are not on the level of human beings, and their level among existing things is below that of a man and above that of a monkey, because they have the image and the resemblance of a man more than a monkey does." Maimonides explaining who is not fit "to participate in the world to come" (Guide for the Perplexed, Book III, chapter 51 cited in Israel Shahak, Hebrew University Professor, Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years. London: Pluto Press, 1997. p. 25). 

". . . the explanation of the matter, [is to be found] in light of what Rabbi Chayim Vital wrote in Shaar HaKedushah (and in Etz Chayim, Portal 5, ch. 2)—that every Jew, whether righteous or wicked, possesses two souls, as it is written, "And neshamot (souls) which I have made. . . The second, uniquely Jewish, soul is truly "a part of G-d above, The souls of the nations of the world (the Gentiles), however, emanate from the other, unclean kelipot which contain no good whatever, as is written in Etz Chayim, Portal 40, ch. 3, that all the good that (Gentiles) do, is done out of selfish motives. So the Gemara comments on the verse, "The kindness of (Gentiles) is sin"—that all the charity and kindness done by (Gentiles) of the world is only for their self-glorification. . ." (Chapters 1 and 2) The lower category consists of three completely unclean and evil kelipot, containing no good whatever. . . From them flow and are derived the souls of all the nations of the world (Gentiles), and the sustaining force of their bodies. Also derived from these kelipot are the souls of all living creatures that are unclean and forbidden to be eaten, and the sustaining force of their bodies" (Tanya, Chapter 6 (chabad.org). 

"Rabbi Kook the Elder, the revered father of the messianic tendency in Jewish fundamentalism, said, 'The difference between a Jewish soul and the souls of non-Jews—all of them in all different levels—is greater and deeper than the difference between a human soul and the souls of cattle.' Rabbi Kook's entire teaching. . . is followed devoutly by, among others, those who have led the settler movement in the occupied West Bank. . . According to the ideologies which underlie Gush Emunum, the militant West Bank settlers group, and Hasidism, non-Jews have 'Satanic souls'. . . Members of Gush Emunum argue that 'what appears to be confiscation of Arab-owned land for subsequent settlement by Jews is in reality not an act of stealing but one of sanctification.' From their perspective the land is redeemed by being transferred from the Satanic to the divine sphere. . . Common to both the Talmud and the Halacha, Orthodox religious law, is a differentiation between Jews and non-Jews. The highly revered Rabbi Menachem Mandel Schneerson, who headed the Chabad movement and wielded great influence in Israel as well [and proclaimed himself messiah], explained that 'The difference between a Jewish and a non-Jewish person stems from the common expression: 'Let us differentiate.' Thus, we do not have a case of profound change in which a person is merely on a superior level. Rather we have a case of 'let us differentiate' between totally different species. This is what needs to be said about the body: the body of a Jewish person is of a totally different quality from the body of all nations of the world.'" Allan C. Brownfield, "It Is Time to Confront the Exclusionary Ethnocentrism," Issues of the American Council for Judaism, Winter 2000, cited in Michael Hoffman, Judaism Discovered, p.365-366. 

Chabad leader Rebbe Schneerson taught that Christianity is a form of mental illness.See his video here:

"And for Christians let there be no hope. . ." Birkat HaMinim, "Benediction" #12 of the Shmone Esreh. 

"It is our duty to praise the Master of All, to ascribe greatness to the molder of primeval creation, for He has not made us like the nations of the lands, for He has not assigned our portion like theirs nor our lot like theirs, for they bow to vanity and emptiness and pray to a god who cannot save—man, ash, blood, bile, stinking flesh, maggot, defiled men and women, adulterers and adulteresses, dying in their iniquity and rotting in their wickedness, worn out dust, rot of maggot [and worm]—and pray to a god who cannot save." Aleinu from Judaic prayer book, Two Nations in Your Womb, Israel Jacob Yuval, University of California Press, 2006, p. 119 

"I want to attack their souls." Rabbi Abraham Heschel, interviewed by Geula Cohen for Ma'ariv, January 4, 1965 as translated by AJC/Paris (mauricepinay.blogspot.com). 

"Every Jew, somewhere in his being, should set apart a zone of hate—healthy, virile hate—for what the German personifies and for what persists in the German." Elie Wiesel: Legends of Our Time, "Appointment with Hate, NY, Avon, 1968, p. 177-178. 

"I too, like Hitler, believe in the power of the blood idea"—Chaim Nachman Bailik, Israel's national poet, in "The Present Hour" (1934). 


ABORTION: WHO IS HUMAN? WHO IS NOT? 

Judaism excuses abortion through the "rodef" pilpul, that the baby is a rodef, a pursuer, an aggressor, whose life the mother may take. (Among many, see "Jewish Law Favors Stem Cell Research," Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles, July 30, 2004). Judaism teaches that the baby is not "nefesh," a person, until it is born. 

"Rashi, the venerated twelfth century Judaic interpreter of the Bible and Talmud, says of the fetus" 'lav nefesh hu—it is not a person." Rabbi Meir Abulafia decreed, 'So long as the fetus is inside the womb, it is not a nefesh and the Torah has no pity on it." The noted Judaic legal scholar Rabbi Isaac Schorr stated: 'The sense of the Talmud is that a fetus is not a person' (Responsa Koah Schorr, no. 20 ["responsa" are authoritative in Judaism and supersede the plain text of the "Hebrew Bible"]). The Talmud contains the expression 'ubar yerech imo'—the fetus is the thigh of its mother, i..e., the fetus is deemed to be part of the pregnant woman's body. The Greek philosopher Aristotle regarded the unborn child in its first seven days as a 'secretion' (ekrysis). In rabbinic law the status of 'secretion' lasts for the first forty days of gestation. In Judaism the woman is not regarded as pregnant until the baby in her womb is more than forty days old. 

"Contrary to these traditions of Judaism, God did not say in the Bible that He recognized the unborn baby only after forty days. He said He recognized it as a being before the child had even formed in the womb (Jeremiah 1:5). As usual, the rabbis go God one better and establish a term of forty days before recognition can be conferred, and that rabbinic recognition is only of the pregnancy itself, not of the humanity of the child. 

"The matter does not rest at the forty day limit, however. In the familiar pattern of rabbinic modification, supplementation, and emendation, enough of these are generated to allow abortion at any time during the pregnancy for almost any reason, however fanciful or arbitrary. For example, if it is decided that an aborted baby does not look like a baby after it has been aborted, then it is not considered to have been an aborted child (Tosefta Niddah 4:5-6) 

"Since the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, the standard American abortion procedure is considerably Talmudic in nature, since the Talmud specifically states that if the unborn baby is adduced to be a rodef the rabbis authorize that it can be chopped up at any time: 'They chop up the child in her womb' (Mishnah Ohalot 7:6)"—Michael Hoffman, Judaism Discovered, ISBN 9780970378453, p. 878-879. 


JUDAISM'S HERMENEUTIC OF DECEIT. SIX CATEGORIES OF LYING PERMITTED BY THE TORAH: 

For scholarship (including Torah scholarship), sexuality, and hospitality (The Talmud: The Steinsaltz Edition, Vol II, p. 49). 

lying to gentiles (Baba Kamma 113a) 

for "peace" (meaning, "it's OK to lie to keep out of trouble") (Yebamoth 65b). 

when everyone should know you are lying, "guzmah" (Hullin 90b).

It is strictly forbidden to moser [inform the non-Judaic authorities on] either a Jewish person or his property. One who mosers a Jewish person or his property has no share in the world to come (Shulchan Aruch, Choshen Mishpat, 388).

PIERCING ONE OF JUDAISM'S BIG LIES

Here is a worthwhile photoessay that pierces yet another Jewish fable (Titus 1:14): 

Lawrence of Cyberia: Tell Me Again, Who Made The Desert Bloom? (lawrenceofcyberia.blogs.com). 

"In order to create an alleged justification for the crime of genocide they have committed against the Palestinian Arabs, the Zionists have tried to convince the world that Palestine was practically uninhabited, 'A land without people for a people without a land.' They created and propagated the myths that the Palestinian Arabs were nomads or semi-nomads without a culture and a civilization, that the Palestinians had neither a national identity nor existence, that the Palestinians lacked an economic structure and roots in the land" (The Encyclopedia of the Palestine Problem, edited by Dr. Issa Nakhleh, Continental Books, P.O. Box 756, Grand Central Station, New York, NY 10163-0756, p. 33, available at palestine-encyclopedia.com). 

". . . In 1882, the Jewish population of Palestine was about 24,000. In 1914, the entire population of Palestine was estimated at 634,133 Muslim and Christian Arabs and 55,413 Jews. In 1920, after the British mandate, the official census showed the Arab population, both Muslim and Christian, at nearly 600,000, still greatly exceeding the Jews, who numbered 66,574. Until 1948 the Arab population continued to exceed the Jewish by roughly 2:1. Ibid., p.25. 

". . . the last official British census in 1931 found Arabs in Jerusalem outnumbered Jews 2:1 with surrounding areas averaging 98% Arab! The Ad Hoc Committee on the Palestinian Question in the United Nations found in 1948 that, except for Haifa, 'the Arabs have a clear majority over the Jews.' Ibid., p. 26. 

"So much for the Israeli . . . claim that for centuries Jews in Jerusalem and surrounding areas have outnumbered a tiny Arab population! 

"During World War I, Arabs fought with the Allies against the Turks in hope of acquiring national independence. After the Balfour Declaration in 1917, the people of Palestine were considered by the League of Nations a 'provisionally independent nation" very close to sovereignty. By 1947 Palestinian Arabs played a predominant role in government under the British. "The total number of government officials was 44,688 persons, of whom 4,314 were British, 30,178 Arabs, 9,276 Jews, and 920 others.' Ibid., p. 28. Arabs also vastly outnumbered Jews in municipal councils and leadership in hundreds of primarily Arab towns and cities throughout Palestine. 

"The land of Palestine had been a breadbasket of agricultural plenty going back to the original inhabitants, the Canaanites and later Philistines (for whom Palestine is named). Enjoying a climate similar to California's, the Old Testament description was a "land that flows with milk and honey." Certainly, much of Palestine in recent centuries had been over-grazed, particularly the mountainous hill country of Judea surrounding Jerusalem. Such barrenness caused visitor Mark Twain to describe it as barren, with hardly an Arab to be seen. Yet, at nearly the same time, "Lawrence Oliphant, who visited Palestine in 1887, wrote that Palestine's Valley of Esdraelon was 'a huge green lake of waving wheat, with its village-crowned mounds rising from it like islands; and it presents one of the most striking pictures of luxurious fertility which it is possible to conceive'." Ibid., p. 33. Numerous pre-20th century accounts, recounted in the Encyclopedia of the Palestine Problem, describe it as a veritable cornucopia of every kind of agricultural produce, with excess exported by the Palestinians even to the nations of Europe. 

The Encyclopedia confirms that before 1948: 

"these Arab towns and villages were not merely place names on a map. They were developed communities containing farms, factories, stores and schools, with an infrastructure of doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, merchants, mechanics, industrialists, workers, and farmers which would be the envy of any developing country today . . . Before 1948 they resided in 12 cities, 8 major towns, and 830 small towns and villages. Arab homes in the cities were either luxurious stone villas with beautiful gardens, or apartments with 2-5 bedrooms. These residences were well-furnished with modern furniture and household goods. No Arab home of the middle and upper classes contained less than eight valuable Persian carpets. All these homes and their furnishings were usurped by Israel"(Ibid. p. 34). 

General Moshe Dayan tells the truth: 

"We came to this country which was already populated by Arabs, and we are establishing a Hebrew, that is, a Jewish state here. Jewish villages were built in the place of Arab villages. You do not even know the names of these Arab villages, and I do not blame you, because these geography books no longer exist. Not only do the books not exist, the Arab villages are not there either. Nahalal arose in the place of Mahalul; Gevat in the place of Jibta; Sarid in the place of Haneifa and Kefar Yehoshua in the place of Tellshaman. There is not one place built in this country that did not have a former Arab population" (Ibid., p. 34). 

"After 1948, Israel took over 12 cities and large towns and 526 small towns and villages. They bulldozed the towns and villages, building new towns with Jewish names (Ibid., "INDEX OF CITIES, TOWNS AND VILLAGES IN PALESTINE" p. 347). 

"The Encyclopedia extensively documents from British records that, far from Palestinians depending on Jewish prosperity, the Zionists were permeated with Marxist/collectivist values, resulting in eventual failure of the "kibbutz" experiment. Fairly new to Mideast agriculture, they were largely inefficient, dependent upon regular massive infusion of Western Jewish capital. Despite a general Israeli policy of boycott of Palestinian goods and services, the Palestinians, with a rapidly growing population in 1948 of 1,444,274, were both politically, socially, and economically racing toward UN-sponsored nationhood in 1948. 

"Such prosperity came to an abrupt, horrific end after the Deir Yassin massacre by Zionist Irgun terrorists on April 9-10, 1948 and many subsequent Jewish outrages and atrocities, panicking 800,000 Palestinians into flight. "In 1948 the Zionists seized 90% of Arab-owned citrus groves, packaging and storage facilities, as well as that year's crops, looting the prosperous Arab citrus growers, making them destitute refugees." The same was true of all aspects of Palestinian industry, including olive oil, weaving, textile, tobacco, leather, dairy, wheat, fishing, and construction. In reality, confiscation of Palestinian resources largely constituted the "miracle" of Israel's sudden abundant agriculture, of which the new state began boasting soon after expulsion of the Palestinians. This delighted evangelicals worldwide who saw it as stunning fulfillment of Biblical prophecy, making the "desert blossom as the rose." In reality, Israel now possessed thousands of acres of citrus, olives, wheat, etc. seized from the foremost agriculturists of the Middle East, Palestinian orchardists and farmers. The Encyclopedia: "The economic achievements of Israel today are built totally on the capital base of lands, property, and possessions usurped from the Palestinian Arabs" (Ibid., p. 34. truthtellers.org). 


"CONTEXT"
"'Context' is everything for the defenders of the Talmud. Fair enough. But by 'context' they do not mean taking into account the surrounding text, but rather submitting to Judaism's own narrative about itself, which includes how it presents problem texts to non-Judaic audiences. . . The rabbis even deny in many cases that there is a plain meaning. . . It is enough that [the rabbi] states it and gentiles believe it; anything else is 'antisemitic.' This pattern of intimidation and thought control is repeated with monotonous effect, by thought cops and apologists for Judaism. It is a stock response intended to frighten off the opposition, premised mainly on the moral authority of the declarative sentences used by the 'expert' on Judaism. Debate ('polemic') on the part of informed skeptics is not permitted, since it constitutes the 'misuse' of a scholar's knowledge of rabbinic texts. Debating tactics and polemical tools are reserved solely for rabbis and their allies, along with just a dash of permissible dissimulation to leaven the burden of swallowing the pottage. And when deception and 'out of context' statements serve to advance Judaism, they are all well and good. . ."

NOAHIDE LAW

"If a Noahite is striving in the learning of Torah. . . reveals new aspects of Torah, he may be PHYSICALLY RESTRAINED and informed that he is liable for CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. . . If the court that is established in consonance with the Seven Universal Laws gives the DEATH PENALTY to a Noahite, the EXECUTION is an atonement for the person's past transgression. . . Furthermore, the Noahite must experience REINCARNATION to be able to atone for transgressions he has done" (Chaim Clorfene, Yakov Rogalsky, "The Path of the Righteous Gentile: An Introduction to the Seven Laws of the children of Noah," (Feldheim Publishers, 1987) p. 42. The book bears an official letter of approval of its contents by Rabbi Mendel Feldman, Shearith Israel Congregation). 

"The Christians are idolaters, and Sunday is their holiday. . ." (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Avodah Zorah, 9;4). 

"The Christians are worshipers of Avodah Zorah ["idolatry"]" (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Ma'akhalot Assurot, 11:7). 

"It is a mitzvah [religious duty], however, to eradicate Jewish traitors, minim [Christians], and apikorsim, ["heretics," i.e., sincere Judaic converts to Christianity] and to cause them to descend to the pit of destruction, since they cause difficulty to the Jews and sway the people away from God, as did Jesus of Nazareth and his students, and Tzadok, Baithos, and their students. May the name of the wicked rot" (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Chapter 10). 

". . . a gentile who worships false gods is liable, [for the death penalty] provided he worships them in the accepted manner [in other words, insincere worship such as (1) faking worship to obtain business or social advantage, as the Marranos [or Donmeh's), or (2) denying Jesus' divinity, does not earn the death penalty]. A gentile is executed for every type of foreign worship which a Jewish court would consider worthy of capital punishment" (Maimonides, Hilchot Melachim XI, Mishneh Torah). 

The Jewish Encyclopedia affirms that the punishment for Christian "idolatry" is beheading ("Laws, Noachian," Jewish Encyclopedia entry, jewishencyclopedia.com). 

One of many possible examples of how the "Noahide Law" system of double-standards is absurdly preferential to "Jews" and tyrannical towards everyone else from the Babylonian Talmud: 

"A non-Jew is put to death on the basis of a decision given by one judge [no jury], and on the basis of testimony given by a single witness, and even if he was not given a proper warning prior to the commission of his offense. He is put to death on the basis of testimony and a decision given by a man but not on the basis of testimony and a decision given by a woman, and the man who testified or decided against him can even be a relative. 

"A Jew can only be put to death by a court of twenty-three judges, and on the basis of the testimony of two male witnesses who are not disqualified from testifying on account of kinship, and after being properly warned against committing the transgression. But none of these rules apply in the case of a non-Jew" (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 57b, Steinsaltz edition, vol.18, page 110). 

Rabbis Yitzhak Ginzburg and Yaakov Yosef endorse Rabbi Yitzhak Shapiro's 2009 book endorsing the killing of Gentile babies and children, adding "It is permissable to kill the Righteous among Nations even if they are not responsible for [threatening Israel]. If we kill a Gentile who has sinned or has violated one of the seven commandments—because we care about the commandments—there is nothing wrong with the murder"  (haaretz.com). 

The serpent used sweet sounding words to seduce Eve in the Garden too. Do not be deceived by the rabbis' sweet words about the Noachide Laws. They are not nearly as benevolent or benign as the rabbis' marketing feigns. 

Much like the word "Torah" makes a Christian wrongly think that the rabbis are referring to the Pentateuch, but actually refer to "Torah SheBeal Peh" (the Oral "Torah" that was later compiled into the Talmud and Kabbalistic books), Christians think that the "Noah" of "Noachide Law" is the biblical Noah, but wrong again. No, the Noah of the Noachide Law is most unbiblical, mocked in the rabbinical literature as an incompetent drunk incapable of fulfilling God's commission, and who compounded the sin of Adam. 

"Three had a passion of agriculture [N.B. farming is an occupation of disrepute in Judaism] and no good was found in them: Cain, Noah, and Uzziah" (Midrash Rabbah: Genesis I, translated by Rabbi Dr. H. Freedman (Soncino, 1983) vol. 1, p. 289). 

"The rabbis teach that Noah ended as a castrate. One story has it that he was castrated by a lion while he was drunk and on his way to have intercourse and this 'scattered his semen.' Alternatively the Midrash says that it was actually Ham who castrated Noah, and that Noah told Ham, 'You have prevented me from doing something in the dark [having sex], therefore your seed will be ugly and dark-skinned'." [More on Maimonides' racism later] (Midrash Rabbah: Genesis I, translated by Rabbi Dr. H. Freedman (Soncino, 1983) vol. 1, p. 283). 

"It is claimed that as 'Noahides,' these 'good' gentiles will not have to follow all the rules of the Talmud of Judaism, only the 'Seven Laws of Noah.' What they are not told is that in order to faithfully adhere to the so-called Seven Laws of Noah, the 'righteous gentiles' are obligated to suffer the prize indignity of submitting to rabbinic interpretations of those laws, which amount to an infinite number of glosses and explications running from here to eternity. A more accurate name for the heavy burdens with which these gullible gentiles are going to bind themselves would be the Seven Billion Noachide Laws. . . Maimonides ruled that when a Judaic murders even a righteous gentile (a gentile who is a friend and ally of Judaism) the Judaic is not to be harmed: 'A Jew who killed a righteous gentile is not executed in a court of law as it says (Exodus 21:14 'If a man shall act intentional against his fellow. . .' (and a gentile is not considered a fellow) and even more so that he is not executed for killing an unrighteous gentile.' (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Rotze'ach 2:11. The Judaic publishing company's commentary accompanying the preceding teaching of Maimonides states that Jesus was an example of a min (plural: minim)" (Michael Hoffman, Judaism Discovered: A Study of the Religion of Racism, Self-Worship, Superstition, and Deceit, ISBN 13: 9780970378453, pp. 496-499). 

The rabbis teach that Jesus Himself was an idolater [Sanhedrin 43a, 107b], even teaching such insanities as claiming that Jesus worshipped a brick [Babylonian Talmud Sanhedrin 67a, 107b]. There are, of course, numerous other scurrilous accusations against Jesus in the Talmud and rabbinical literature. Though the passages have been denied and expurgated Talmud editions have been published, often using code words for Jesus, Princeton Professor and Director of JUDAIC Studies Peter Schafer has examined dozens of Talmud editions in the original and vernacular languages. Schafer not only adduces the explicit references to Jesus of Nazareth, but he also traces the code words used in the Talmud editions expurgated and sanitized for Gentile consumption. Schafer traces from edition to tractate to folio how "Balaam," "that man," "the carpenter," "ben Pandera" (son of Pandera), the blank spaces, and the rest of the code words refer to Jesus of Nazareth. In his book "Jesus in the Talmud" (ISBN 13: 978-0691129266) Schafer has affirmed that the Talmud teaches that that Jesus was an idolater [Sanhedrin 43a, 107b], was a "mamzer" [bastard] conceived adulterously in "niddah" [menstrual filth] by a Roman soldier named Pandera [Kallah 51a] of a whore [Sanhedrin 106a] and that He is now in Hell boiling in feces and, in some editions because Jesus is accused of sexual perversion, semen [Gittin 57a]. Schafer documents much more, including the Talmud claim that the Sanhedrin justly executed Jesus because he was an idolater [Sanhedrin 43a, 107b] who worshipped a brick [Sanhedrin 67a], even boasting that the Sanhedrin overcame Roman opposition to the execution of Jesus [Sanhedrin 43a]. 


In the context of Noachide Laws, why is this important? Because idoloaters are liable for execution under halacha, Talmudic Law. 

Practicing Christians worship Jesus as True God and True man, hence, under Torah law, are idolaters liable for execution.


REINCARNATION

Search "gilgul." "The sages of the true wisdom teach that every Jewish soul must REINCARNATE many times until it has fulfilled all the 613 mitzvos in action, speech, and thought" (Shulchan Aruch HaRav: Hilchos Talmud Torah 1:4). 

Rabbi Ovadia Yosef on the REINCARNATION of Judaic souls: (independent.co.uk). 

"If a Noahite is striving in the learning of Torah. . . reveals new aspects of Torah, he may be physically restrained and informed that he is liable for capital punishment. . . If the court that is established in consonance with the Seven Universal Laws gives the death penalty to a Noahite, the execution is an atonement for the person's past transgression. . . Furthermore, the Noahite must experience REINCARNATION to be able to atone for transgressions he has done" (Chaim Clorfene & Yakov Rogalsky, "The Path of the Righteous Gentile: An Introduction to the Seven Laws of the children of Noah," (Feldheim Publishers, 1987) p. 42. The book bears an official letter of approval of its contents by Rabbi Mendel Feldman, Shearith Israel Congregation). 


PAGAN POLYTHEISTIC JUDAISM

'Orthodox' do not follow Mosaic Law, but the perverse Master Race and pagan precepts of the 'Oral' Torah (see below) for which Jesus emphatically damned the Pharisees and their followers as "children of Hell" and exposed them as descendants of Cain (Matthew 23:15; 33-35). 

The Kabalistic books of the Oral Torah, including the Zohar and Sefer Yetzirah, are in the lineage of Egyptian and Babylonian black magic that spawned the idolatry of the Golden Calf, fornication, and sacrificing their children to the demon Moloch (Leviticus 20:3-5, I Kings 11:5-33, etc.). Contemporary Judaism retains worship of pagan "strange gods" no less than in the days of the Israelites (I Kings 8:8; Malachis 2:8-12). Birkat ha-Hammah sun worship mauricepinay.blogspot.com persists although Ezekiel 8:16-17 specifically damns it as an abomination in God's sight. Likewise Moon worship, kiddush levanah mauricepinay.blogspot.com, and polytheism, the worship of the goddess Shekinah mauricepinay.blogspot.com.

More on pagan polytheistic Judaism—the rabbis' magic skulls: sott.net. 

"There are two kinds of necromancy: the one where the dead is raised by naming him, the other where he is invoked by means of a skull" (Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin 65b). 


TORAH

"This is not an uncommon impression and one finds it sometimes among Jews as well as Christians—that Judaism is the religion of the Hebrew Bible. It is, of course, a fallacious impression. Judaism is not the religion of the Bible" (Rabbi Ben Zion Bokser, Judaism and the Christian Predicament, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1967, p.59, 159). 

"The Jewish religion as it is today traces its descent, without a break, through all the centuries, from the Pharisees. Their leading ideas and methods found expression in a literature of enormous extent, of which a very great deal is still in existence. The Talmud is the largest and most important single member of that literature, and round it are gathered a number of Midrashim, partly legal (Halachic) and partly works of edification (Haggadic). This literature, in its oldest elements, goes back to a time before the beginning of the Common Era, and comes down into the Middle Ages. Through it all run the lines of thought which were first drawn by the Pharisees, and the study of it is essential for any real understanding of Pharisaism" (Universal Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 3 p. 474). 

"Pharisaism became Talmudism, Talmudism became Medieval Rabbinism, and Medieval Rabbinism became Modern Rabbinism. But throughout these changes of name, inevitable adaptation of custom, and adjustment of Law, the spirit of the ancient Pharisee survives unaltered" (Rabbi Dr. Finkelstein, The Pharisees: The Sociological Background of Their Faith, p. xxi). 

"The Talmud is the written form of that which in the time of Jesus, was called the 'Tradition of the Elders,' and to which He makes frequent allusions." (Michael L. Rodkinson, The History of the Talmud: From the Time of its Formation About 200 B. C. up to the Present Time, Kessinger Publishing, LLC (June 8, 2006), ISBN-13: 978-1428631366, p.70). 

"The complex of rabbinically ordained practices . . . including most of the rules for the treatment of Scripture itself—do not derive from Scripture at all. Rabbinic Judaism's initial concern was with the elaboration and refinement of it's own system. Attaching the system to scripture was secondary. It therefore is misleading to depict rabbinic Judaism primarily as a consequence of an exegetical process or the organic unfolding of Scripture. Rather, rabbinic Judaism began as the work of a small, ambitious, and homogeneous group of pseudo-priests. . . By the third century (A.D.) the rabbis expressed their self-conception in the ideology of "oral Torah" which held that a comprehensive body of teachings and practices (halachot) not included in Scripture had been given by God and through Moses only to the rabbinic establishment" (Rabbi Jacob Nuesner, Rabbinic Judaism: Structure and System, p. 31-34). 

Don't get deceived by of the oldest rabbinical tricks, the claim that the Talmud is based on "Torah." A Christian assumes that "Torah" = Pentateuch, but there's the trick. In Judaism there are at least FIVE definitions of Torah. Here's the proof: 

Please note FOUR definitions of Torah in the Jewish Encyclopedia's entry on Torah: 

"Originally, in order to maintain the distinction between the written Torah (see written law) and various traditional interpretations, customs and practices, the rabbis forbade the commitment to writing of the additional material. However, when it became too voluminous and chaotic conditions made oral transmission too uncertain, the ban was lifted and the material organized and transcribed in the form of the Mishnah, the Talmud, and other rabbinic works. The rabbis expressed their view that 'two Torahs' were given at Sinai, a Written Torah [Torah She Bich Tav, DEFINITION #1] and an Oral Torah [Torah SheBeal Peh, DEFINITION #2] (see oral law) and that at least some of the oral traditions relating to the meaning of basic biblical concepts were as authoritative as the written text (see halakah le-mosheh mi-sinai). In a sense the Oral Torah came to be regarded as more important than the Written Torah inasmuch as the explanations and understanding of the latter depended upon the former. A third meaning of the word 'Torah' therefore includes elements of the Oral Torah, which are considered authoritative or deoraita – 'from the Torah.' Finally in its broadest sense, the word 'Torah' is sometimes used to refer to the entire corpus of Halacha and Aggadah, [DEFINITION #3] Written and Oral, from the Bible up to and including the latest Responsa and homiletical interpretations of the rabbis [DEFINITION #4]. . . ." (The New Encyclopedia of Judaism, Geoffrey Wigoder editor in Chief, New York: New York University Press, 2002, ISBN 0814793996, page 778). 

Please note a FIFTH definition of Torah according to the Holy Father's favorite rabbi, "a great scholar" (Benedict XVI, Jesus of Nazareth, p.71): 

". . . The rabbi constituted the projection of the divine on earth. Honor was due him more than to the scroll of the Torah, for through his learning and logic he might alter the very content of Mosaic revelation. He was Torah [DEFINITION #5], not merely because he lived by it, but because at his best he constituted as compelling an embodiment of the heavenly model as did a Torah scroll itself." (Rabbi Jacob Neusner, "The Phenomenon of the Rabbi in Late Antiquity: II The Ritual of 'Being a Rabbi' in Later Sasanian Babylonia," Numen, Vol.17, Fasc. 1., Feb., 1970, p.3-4). 

It gets worse because these "Torah" are on an ever-widening trajectory from God. Consider explicit corollaries of the great scholar's presumption that, because the rabbis are divine, they can "alter the very content of Mosaic revelation". 

". . . the Babylonian Talmud represents God in the flesh" (Rabbi Jacob Neusner, Rabbinic Judaism, Minneapolis MN: Augsburg Fortress, 1995. p. 62). 

"The Holy One, Blessed be He, speaks Torah out of the mouths of all rabbis" (Haggadah 15b). 

"The Bavli [Babylonian Talmud] has formed the definitive statement of Judaism from the time of its closure to the present day" (Rabbi Jacob Neusner, quoted by Norman F. Cantor, The Sacred Chain: A History of the Jews, p. 112). 

The occultic portion of the Talmud, the Kabala, at Tikkunei Zohar 1:27b refers to the Mishnah of the Talmud as "the burial place of Moses." The reference is an apt double entendre because the Talmud at Shabbat 15 teaches that it supersedes and nullifies the Old Testament, so "buries" the Pentateuch of Moses. 

"Think not that I will accuse you to the Father: There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust. For if you did believe in Moses, you would perhaps believe me also; for he wrote of me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words" (John 5:43-47)? 

Since converts from Judaism revealed the foundational teachings of Judaism, much effort has been invested in sanitizing vernacular translations of the Talmud. 

These sanitized editions are useful to the rabbis: "See it's not there. . ." Or "The tractate is about 'Balaam'." 

In the sanitized Talmud editions numerous code word substitutions are used for Christians (min, Cuthean, Egyptian, Epicurean, etc.) and Jesus of Nazareth ("that man," "the carpenter," "Balaam," "ben Pandera, a reference to the Talmud's teaching that Jesus was the bastard of a whore who committed adultery with a Roman soldier named Pandera, and even blank spaces). 

The Talmud (Torah SheBeal Peh) teaches that Jesus was a b-stard born of an adulterous relationship (Kallah 51a) of a whore (Sanhedrin 106a) and that He is now in Hell boiling in feces because he "worshipped a brick" and, semen because he is accused of sexual perversion (Gittin 57a). 

The Talmud Sanhedrin 43a boasts that the Sanhedrin convicted Jesus and, at the Jewish court's instigation, He was crucified, "hanged," even though the Romans were "inclined toward acquittal" of Jesus; therefore Jewish denial and blame-shifting to the Romans is a lie. The infamous Toldoth Jeschu, Maimonides' Hilkoth Akun V, 3 and Letter to Yemen, and the 1905 Jewish Encyclopedia (page 170), all boast of Jewish responsibility for Christ's death. The Talmud notes that Jesus deserved four more deaths. Sanhedrin 52a suggests Jesus should have been strangled while immersed in dung. There are other Talmudic passages that describe Jesus as an idolatrous sex freak, practicing black magic —and more.


PURSUING THE ANTI-BIBLICAL NATURE OF JUDAISM AND ITS TALMUD: 

"On the surface, Scripture plays little role in the Mishanaic system, The Mishnah [of the Talmud] rarely cites a verse of Scripture, refers to Scripture as an entity, links its own ideas to those of Scripture, or lays claim to originate in what Scripture has said, even by indirect or remote allusion to a Scriptural verse of teaching. . . Formally, redactionally, and linguistically the Mishnah stands in splendid isolation from Scripture. . . the Mishnah constitutes Torah. [definition #2 'Written Torah'] It too is a statement of revelation, 'Torah revealed to Moses at Sinai.' But this part of revelation has come down in a form different from the well-known, written part, the Scripture. This tradition truly deserves the name 'tradition,' because for a long time it was handed down orally, not in writing, until given the written formulation now before us in the Mishnah. . . Since some of the named authorities in the chain of tradition appear throughout the materials of the Mishnah, the claim is that what these people say comes to them from Sinai through the processes of qabbalah and massoret—handing down 'traditioning.' So the reason. . . that the Mishnah does not cite Scripture is that it does not have to" (Rabbi Jacob Neusner, The Mishnah: A New Translation. New Haven CT: Yale University Press, 1988. pp. xxxv-xxxvi). 

Note the casual admission that both "qabbalah and massoret [the vaunted, but bowdlerized, 'Hebrew Bible']" change Scripture through "process," "traditioning." In Judaism tradition is not fixed or faithful, but is an ever-changing "process" that is described as "traditioning." This is why "the latest Responsa and homiletical interpretations of the rabbis" are Torah, [definition #4] hence authoritative in Judaism. 

Indeed all this oral "traditioning" is precisely what Jesus fingered as "make void the commandments of God for the traditions of men" )Mark 7:9). Since the rabbis are free to "alter even the very content of Mosaic revelation" with impunity, we begin to understand why Jesus said, "there is one that accuseth you, Moses" (John 5:45-47). 

Do not be misled by a rabbi's mere mention of the word Torah. You must pin him down: "Which 'Torah'?" Then watch out for the mental reservations, and Kol Nidre deceit that will inevitably follow. 


JEWISH MYSTICISM

According to Rabbi Steinsaltz, Jewish mysticism—or Kabbalah—is the official theology of the Jewish people. Although the world of Kabbalah is profoundly symbolic and abstract, its teachings are of tremendous significance to the individual and to society alike. Its influences are evident in all Jewish spheres—the prayer book, the Talmud, and Jewish philosophy. Kabbalah is not a separate area of Torah knowledge, but rather the hidden, spiritual dimension of the revealed aspects of the Torah. These revealed facets of Torah—such as halakha (Jewish law)—speak primarily about visible, physical things; Kabbalah, on the other hand, speaks directly about spiritual entities, like the system of olamot (spiritual "worlds," or graduated levels of reality) and sefirot (divine "attributes," or channels of divine energy) through which God creates, sustains and directs the universe. It also discusses the interaction between those entities and the performance of mitzvot in the physical world. It is for this reason that Kabbalah has been called the soul of the Torah.

The character of Kabbalah is perhaps manifested most clearly in Hasidut. By changing the terminology of Kabbalah yet maintaining its messages, Hasidut offers a simpler, more accessible way of unlocking its secrets. The Hasidic movement, which has prompted dramatic changes in the outlook of the Jewish people, began in the late 18th century with the teachings of Rabbi Yisrael Ba'al Shem Tov. By re-emphasizing the value of every Jew, the Ba'al Shem Tov provided his disciples with the opportunity to link the individual closer to the Almighty. Hasidism has breathed new vitality into Jewish life, offering an alternate route to the arduous and, for some, unattainable path of study" (steinsaltz.org). 

"Talmud – The authoritative body of Jewish law and lore accumulated over a period of seven centuries (c. 200 BCE – c. 500 CE) in Erets Israel and Babylonia" (The New Encyclopedia of Judaism, Geoffrey Wigoder, editor in Chief, New York: New York University Press, 2002, ISBN 0814793996, p. 747). 

The Novus Ordo's Offertory was lifted from the same Torah SheBe'al Peh ("Oral Torah" = Talmud jewishencyclopedia.com) that blasphemes the Holy Family on Judaeo-Roman Catholic reckoning: catholictradition.org. 


TORAH ON HOMOSEXUALITY, BESTIALITY, COPROPHAGIA, & PEDOPHILIA

"Israel is not to be accused of pederasty" (Kiddushin 82a). 

A salient example of how the rabbis nullify God's Law with their Oral Torah. 

God's Law in the Hebrew Bible: 

Leviticus 18:22 "Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind, because it is an abomination." 

Torah nullifying God's Law: 

Sanhedrin 54b "If a boy under the age of nine perpetrated sodomy upon an adult, the adult is not liable for punishment, for the intercourse of a boy under nine years of age is not legally an act of intercourse. Since a child less than nine years old cannot commit sodomy, he can also not be the object of sodomy. . . This Baraita supports Rav, for it teaches that if a man engaged in homosexual intercourse with a child under the age of nine, he is exempt from liability". 

". . . intercourse with a boy under nine years old is not considered a significant sexual act. . ." (Ketubot 11b). 

"If a girl is less than three years old, it is permitted to be secluded with her. Likewise, if a boy is less than nine years old a woman is permitted to be alone with him" (Kitzur Shulchan Aruch: A Classic Guide to Jewish Law (Metsudah Publications, 1996) v. 2, p. 1023). 

"If a grown up man has intercourse with a little girl, it is nothing, for having intercourse with a girl less than three years old is like putting a finger in the eye" (Ketubot 11b). 

There is also the Torah's excuse for "unwitting" sodomy [Sanhedrin 54b] as if such an unnatural and intrinsically difficult act could be accidental. As Hoffman opines, such a loophole is "beneath contempt" (Judaism Discovered: A Study of the Anti-Biblical Religion of Racism, Self-Worship, Superstition, and Deceit. ISBN 13: 9780970378453 p. 676-705). 

At tractate Yebamoth 63a the Torah teaches that "Adam had intercourse with all the beasts and animals" in the Garden of Eden. At tractate Gittin 69b the Torah teaches that the cure of a catarrh is to "take the excrement of a white dog kneaded with balsam." Then, of course, the rabbis still perform their oral circumcision ritual Mezizah b'peh on little boys, sometimes causing the death of innocent babies (nytimes.com). 

Visit jewishencyclopedia.com, then scroll down to: 

Mezizah: By this is meant the sucking of the blood from the wound. The mohel takes some wine in his mouth and applies his lips to the part involved in the operation, and exerts suction, after which he expels the mixture of wine and blood into a receptacle (see Fig. 4, below) provided for the purpose. This procedure [repeatedly sucking the boy's privates] is repeated several times, and completes the operation, except as to the control of the bleeding and the dressing of the wound.

Synopsis of the ruling of the Ungvarer Rov, Rabbi Menashe Klein: An 8-year-old girl who has been raped and who identifies her father as her rapist to a trained medical professional is not to be believed. The medical professional is forbidden to contact law enforcement, social workers or child protection or do anything that could get the father arrested. If the medical professional is about to call police and cannot be stopped by any other means, he can and should be killed. And the father who raped the little girl? The father remains just as he was before, free.

DEICIDE

"On Passover Eve they hanged Jesus of Nazareth. And the herald went out before him for forty days: 'Jesus of Nazareth is going out to be stoned because he practiced sorcery, incited [to idol worship] and led Israel astray. Whoever knows an argument in his favor should come and argue on his behalf.' But they did not find an argument in his favor, and they hanged him on Passover Eve . . . Jesus . . . had close connections with the non-Jewish authorities, and those authorities were interested in his acquittal. Thus it was necessary to give him all the opportunity to clear himself, so that the justice of his conviction not be challenged . . . Was Jesus of Nazareth deserving of a search for an argument in his favor? He was an inciter, and the Torah (lit., "the Merciful") says: 'You shall not spare, nor shall you conceal him!'" (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 43a, Steinsaltz edition, Vol XVII, Part III). 

". . . some medieval apologists for Judaism, as Nachmanides and Salman Zebi, . . . [asserted] that the 'Yeshu' mentioned in the Talmud was not identical with Jesus; this, however, is merely a subterfuge" (Jewish Encyclopedia, "Jesus of Nazareth" jewishencyclopedia.com). 

". . . the Talmud [Torah SheBeal Peh] is here offering a subtle commentary upon Jesus' political connections. The Gospels portray the Roman governor Pontius Pilate as going to great lengths to spare Jesus (Mark 15:6-15). Although this passage may well have been written to appease the Roman authorities and blame the Jews, the Talmudic passage points in the same direction . . . [Nonsense, the Jews were of no consequence when Mark entered the public domain]. 

". . . the passage suggests rabbinic willingness to take responsibility for the execution of Jesus. No effort is made to pin his death upon the Romans. In all likelihood, the passage in question emanates from fourth-century Babylon, then the center of Talmudic scholarship, and beyond the reach of both Rome and Christianity. Although several hundred years had elapsed since the lifetime of Jesus, and therefore this is not at all a contemporary source, the Talmudic passage indicates rabbinic willingness to acknowledge, at least in principle, that in a Jewish court and in a Jewish land, a real-life Jesus would indeed have been executed . . . ("Jesus in the Talmud," Steven Bayme, American Jewish Committee National Director, September 24, 2003, jewishtribalreview.org). 

"The very fact that the Talmud's claim of Jesus' closeness to the Roman government reflects some knowledge . . . of the New Testament narrative, particularly of John's version of it . . . this detail exonerates the Roman government from the blame of Jesus' condemnation and consequently, adopting the Gospels' Message, puts the thrust of the accusation on the Jews . . . What we then have here in the [Babylonian Talmud] is a powerful confirmation of the New Testament Passion narrative, a creative rereading, however, that not only knows some of its distinct details but proudly proclaims Jewish responsibility of Jesus' execution" (Jesus in the Talmud, Peter Schafer, Princeton University Press, p.73-74). 

Peter Schafer's (Director of Judaic Studies at Princeton University) scholarship is impeccable and he has concluded that, "Finally, as to the [Talmud] narratives about Jesus' execution, the fate of his disciples, and Jesus' punishment in hell, there can be no doubt that they are talking about Jesus/Jesus the Nazarene . . . One major result of our survey of the talmudic manuscripts was the finding that the Jesus passages abound in the manuscripts not only before the implementation of Christian censorship but even thereafter. This evidence strongly suggests that indeed Jesus of Nazareth is the original [subject] of our Bavli [Babylonian Talmud] stories and that the available manuscripts do reflect the earliest possible form of our stories" (Jesus in the Talmud, Peter Schafer, p.142-143, Princeton University Press). 

Schafer not only adduces the explicit references to Jesus of Nazareth, but he also traces the code words used in the Talmud editions expurgated and sanitized for Gentile consumption. Schafer traces from edition to tractate to folio how "Balaam," "that man," "the carpenter," "ben Pandera" (son of Pandera), the blank spaces, and the rest of the code words refer to Jesus of Nazareth. So, as has so many times been demonstrated, Schafer shows the Talmud teaches that Jesus was a "mamzer" [bastard] conceived adulterously in "niddah" [menstrual filth] by a Roman soldier named Pandera [Kallah 51a] of a whore [Sanhedrin 106a] and that He is now in Hell boiling in feces and, in some editions because Jesus is accused of sexual perversion, semen [Gittin 57a]. Schafer documents much more, including the Talmud claim that the Sanhedrin justly executed Jesus because he was an idolater [Sanhedrin 43a] who worshipped a brick [Sanhedrin 67a], even boasting that the Sanhedrin overcame Roman opposition to the execution of Jesus [Sanhedrin 43a]. 

Censorship of rabbinic texts has historically presented rabbinic apologists with the opportunity to dissemble claiming that the "Talmud doesn't say anything bad about Jesus" by referring to censored Talmud texts. Meanwhile, the rabbis passed Chesronos HaShas among each other which contained the censored passages so they could continue teaching "Jews" the hateful anti-Christian teachings that the censors erased. 

Matthew 21:38, "But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the Heir: come, let us kill Him, and we shall have His inheritance".

John 19:11, ". . . he that hath delivered Me to thee, hath the greater sin." 

John 11:47-53, "The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this Man doth many miracles? If we let Him alone so, all will believe in Him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation. But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing. Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that One Man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation. And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed. From that day therefore they devised to put him to death". 

Acts 3:12-15, "But Peter seeing, made answer to the people: Ye men of Israel, why wonder you at this? or why look you upon us, as if by our strength or power we had made this man to walk? The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and denied before the face of Pilate, when he judged He should be released. But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you. But the Author of Life you killed, whom God hath raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses". 

I Thessalonians 2:14-15, "For you, brethren, are become followers of the churches of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered the same things from your own coutrymen, even as they have from the Jews, Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and the prophets, and have persecuted us, and please not God, and are adversaries to all men". 

MEGALOMANIA

The Koliner rebbe [17th century rabbi of Prague] states: "Our Zaddikim's (famous Orthodox rabbis) words are more important than the Torah of Moses As our Sages teach: A Zaddik decrees, and God obeys" (Jeremy Dauber, Antonio's Devils: Writers of the Jewish Enlightenment and the Birth of Modern Hebrew and Yiddish Literature, Stanford University, 2004, ISBN-13: 978-0804749015, p. 276, also documented in Judaism Discovered, p. 298). 

". . . The rabbi constituted the projection of the divine on earth. Honor was due him more than to the scroll of the Torah, for through his learning and logic he might alter the very content of Mosaic revelation. He was Torah, not merely because he lived by it, but because at his best he constituted as compelling an embodiment of the heavenly model as did a Torah scroll itself" (Rabbi Jacob Neusner, "The Phenomenon of the Rabbi in Late Antiquity: II The Ritual of 'Being a Rabbi' in Later Sasanian Babylonia," Numen, Vol.17, Fasc. 1., Feb., 1970, p.3-4). 

"God smiled and said: 'My sons have defeated Me, My sons have defeated Me!' God's sons 'defeated him' with their arguments. Rabbi Yehoshua was correct in his contention that a view confirmed by majority vote must be accepted, even where God Himself holds the opposite view" (Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Bava Metzia 59b, Steinsaltz Edition [NY: Random House 1990], Vol. III p.237).

"The [Pharisaic-Rabbinic] schools believed that in heaven God and the angels studied Torah [i.e., Talmud/Kabbalah] just as the rabbis did on earth. God donned phylacteries like a rabbi. He prayed in rabbinic mode . . . He guided the affairs of the world according to the rules of the Torah, like the rabbi in his court. One exegesis of the Creation-legend taught that God had looked into the Torah and therefrom had created the world. Moreover, heaven was aware above of what the rabbis in particular thought, said, and did below. The myth of the Torah was multi-dimensional. It included the striking detail that whenever the most recent rabbi was destined to discover through proper exegesis of the tradition was as much of a part of the way revealed to Moses as was a sentence of Scripture itself. It was therefore possible to participate in the giving of the law, as it were, by appropriate, logical inquiry into the law. God himself, studying and living by Torah, was believed to subject himself to these same rules of logical inquiry, so if an earthly court overruled the testimony, delivered through some natural miracles, of the heavenly one, God would rejoice, crying out, 'My sons have conquered me! My sons have conquered me!' (Rabbi Jacob Neusner, "The Phenomenon of the Rabbi in Late Antiquity: II The Ritual of 'Being a Rabbi' in Later Sasanian Babylonia," Numen, Vol.17, Fasc. 1., Feb., 1970, pp.3-4).

TORAH IN THE TOILET

"After each bowel movement or urination, even of one drop, you should wash your hands and recite the berachah, asher yatzar. If you urinated or moved your bowels and forgot to recited the berachah, asher yatzar, and after urinating or moving your bowels again, you remembered that you did not recite the berachah, you need to recite the berachah only once. After partaking of a laxative that induces diarrhea, and you know that you will use the toilet numerous times, you should not recite the berachah until after all excrement has passed through you" (Berakoth 23a). 

"And our rabbis taught: One who goes to the bathroom in Judea should not do so east and west, but rather north and south. In Galilee he should do so only east and west . . . It has been taught: Rabbi Akiva said: once I went in the bathroom and spied upon Rabbi Joshua while he was on the toilet, and I learned from him three things. I learned that one does not sit east and west, but north and south; I learned that one defecates not standing but sitting; and I learned that it is proper to wipe with the left hand and not with the right. R. Tanhum said: 'Whoever behaves modestly in a bathroom is delivered from three things: from snakes, from scorpions, and from evil spirits and disturbing dreams" (Berakoth 61b-62a). 

" . . . it is permitted to brush off drops of urine even with one's right hand, and one may use that hand to kill a louse. When one urinates while standing, and many drops of urine will fall on his feet if he does not lift his penis, he is permitted to raise it by lifting his testicles. If the drops of urine fall on his feet, he should clean them off immediately with his hands and not walk among people in this manner (since drops of urine on a person's feet may arouse the suspicion that his penis is mutilated and his children are illegitimate). Him not hold the penis itself to raise it, for 'he who holds his organ is considered as if he brought a flood upon the world,' lest he become aroused and emit seed wastefully. [This stringency applies] unless he holds the penis from the corona downward, i.e., towards the ground, for this will not arouse him. Alternatively, he may hold [his organ] with a thick cloth, for this too will not arouse him. When a person is married, and his wife is in the same city as he is, and she is ritually pure, the letter of the law permits him to hold his penis even above the corona" (Niddah 13a-43a). 


TORAH ON WOMEN

". . . a man may do whatever he pleases with his wife at intercourse: meat which comes from the abattoir may be eaten salted, roasted, cooked or seethed; so with fish from the fishmonger. . . A woman came before Rab and complained [of her husband's sodomy with her], Rabbi replied: 'Wherein does it differ from fish'?" (Nedarim 20b, Soncino edition, p. 58). 

Thanks to the encyclopedic tome by Michael Hoffman, "Judaism Discovered: A Study of the Anti-Biblical Religion of Racism, Self-Worship, Superstition, and Deceit" (ISBN9780970378453): 

The birth of a girl is a sad occurrence (Baba Bathra 16b). 

Women are a "Vain treasure" to their fathers (Sanhedrin 110b). 

Thank you God for not making me a gentile, a woman, or a slave (Menahoth 43b-44a). 

If two women sit at a crossroads, one on this side and the other on the other side, and they face one another, they are certainly witches (Pesahim 111a). 

A woman who had intercourse with a beast is eligible to marry a Jewish priest. A woman who has sex with a demon is also eligible to marry a Jewish priest (Yebamoth 59b). 

It is not good to talk to women, not even your own wife (Aboth). 

Women are lightheaded (Kiddushin 29b). 

It is permissible to divorce your wife if she burns your dinner, or if you see a prettier girl (Gittin 91a). 

. . . the best of women is filled with witchcraft (Kiddushin 66c). 

. . . the more wives, the more witchcraft (Mishnah Abot 2:7). 

Gentile women are "Niddah, Shifchah, Goyyah, and Zonah" [menstrual filth, slaves, heathens, and whores] (Sanhedrin 81b-82a). 

"At the end of those seven days, during which the woman is supposed to wear white underwear and sleep on white sheets to detect spotting, she inserts a white cloth deep into her vaginal canal. Some also use cloth wadding that they leave in place for about 20 minutes at sunset. If the cloth is clean, the woman then visits a ritual bath, or mikvah. for purification and intimate marital relations are permitted to resume. If the cloth is not clean, there are rules about which stains are insignificant and which require another seven-day period of cleanliness. In some cases, the cloth is brought to a rabbi for inspection" (Doborah Sonntag, "Jerusalem Journal: Women Seizing Counseling Role on 'Family Purity'," New York Times, April 11, 2001, nytimes.com). 

"An intricate set of laws has been established by the rabbis for regulating the woman's contact with others during her Niddah [menstruation] time. Many of these laws (though not all) are derived from the binding and authoritative post-Talmudic Tur and Shulchan Aruch halachic codifications. During that time she has the status of a Niddah, the following are forbidden: 

1. Women may not engage in frivolous or lightheaded conduct such as excessive laughter or joking. 
2. She may not engage in sports or games, 
3. The use of cosmetics during the Niddah status is prohibited, with the loophole being that if she needs cosmetics to keep her from appearing hideous in her husband's eyes, a moderate amount may be applied. 
4. A husband may not touch his wife when she is a Niddah; not even his small finger may touch her. A woman may not touch her husband when she is a Niddah, not even her small finger may touch him. 
5. It is prohibited to touch her even through clothing or outer garments. Therefore the clothing she is wearing cannot be touched. 
6. Handing an object into her hands, or receiving it from her is prohibited, even if the object is a long one. 
7. If the kallah (bride) at her own wedding is Niddah, then the chasan (groom) may only place the ring on his future wife's finger it he can do so without touching her fingers. It is prohibited to pass a child from a father's hands to the mother's hands while the mother is Niddah. 
8. The husband may not kiss a child who is in the mother's arms, nor may the mother kiss a child in her husband's arms. 
9. The husband may not place an object into his wife's pocket or handbag, shopping bag or anything she is carrying. Similarly he may not remove anything from the pockets, purses, or bags. 
10. Throwing an object in the husband's hand to his wife's lap, or throwing an object from the wife's lap to her husband's hand, is prohibited. Certain poskim hold that the husband or the wife is permitted to throw an object upward and the other may catch it as it falls (as long as this is not done for enjoyment) 
11. When a woman who is a Niddah is invited to serve as the kvatter (the person designated to carry the infant boy to the circumcision), she must decline the offer. 
12. Picking up a lightweight object is prohibited to the husband if his wife is touching it. 
13. It is not permissible for a husband to sit on his wife's bed when she is a Niddah, even if she is not present. 
14. The husband should refrain from blowing off a feather or dust off his wife's garments. Fanning her or blowing on her (e.g., in hot weather) is prohibited. It is similarly prohibited for her to do these things for her husband. 
15. One may not light a candle or a cigarette from a lit candle from a match that his wife is holding, nor may he warm himself from its heat. 
16. It is permissible for a wife to hold the Havdallah candle for her husband, even though he will benefit from its light. However, since handing or receiving is prohibited, he may not hand the candle to her before Havdallah nor may he receive it from her after Havdallah, to extinguish it. 
17. Eating or drinking together at the same table is prohibited. 
18. Eating or drinking together at the same table may be allowed if there is a visible obstruction present.
19. An object that is usually not on the table, such as a vase or candlestick, may be utilized as a divider when eating or drinking together at the same table. 
20. A husband and wife may not eat from the same plate. 
21. This applies only when the food is eaten immediately upon removal from the plate. However where a plate of food is placed on the table, it is permissible for both of them to remove food from the plate and place it onto their individual plates and then eat it from their own plates. 
22. Not all types of food are included in the prohibition. Only those foods that only a husband and wife would consume from the same dish (for example, soup from the same bowel) are forbidden. Those foods that two strangers would share from the same communal bowl (popcorn etc.) are permissible. 
23. The husband may not drink from a beverage in a glass that his wife was drinking from, with the following exceptions: if a child drank from the glass or cup after his wife drank from it; if the contents of the glass or cup was transferred to another cup, glass or bottle; if she drank from a glass or cup and then left the room, the husband may drink the beverage remaining in her cup. 
24. Laying together in the same bed is prohibited, no matter how big or wide the bed. 
25. Sleeping in separate beds that touch each other is forbidden. There must be sufficient distance between the separate beds so that the husband cannot roll from his bed to hers, one cubit (approx 26 inches) minimum. 
26. A woman who is Niddah may not visit a Judaic cemetery" (Michael Hoffman, Judaism Discovered: A Study of the Anti-Biblical Religion of Racism, Self-Worship, Superstition, and Deceit, ISBN9780970378453, p. 745-747). 

Of course you need to know WHEN those rules apply and WHEN different rules apply, so you need to know the rules that define Niddah and the complex rabbinical rules of menstrual science, stains which are Niddah and which are not, hence: 

"At the end of those seven days, during which the woman is supposed to wear white underwear and sleep on white sheets to detect spotting, she inserts a white cloth deep into her vaginal canal. Some also use cloth wadding that they leave in place for about 20 minutes at sunset. If the cloth is clean, the woman then visits a ritual bath, or mikvah. for purification and intimate marital relations are permitted to resume. If the cloth is not clean, there are rules about which stains are insignificant and which require another seven-day period of cleanliness. In some cases, the cloth is brought to a rabbi for inspection" (Doborah Sonntag, "Jerusalem Journal: Women Seizing Counseling Role on 'Family Purity'," New York Times, April 11, 2001, nytimes.com). 

This is critically important because: "Pharisaism begins in menstrual blood" (Rabbi Jacob Neusner in Charlotte Elisheva Fonrobert, Menstrual Purity (Stanford University Press, 2000) p. 125).

Author of blood libel book holds distribution to make changes by Ofri Ilani (haaretz.co.il). 

While the Always Innocent Perpetual Victims wailed that the perpetrators of St. Simon's ritual crucifixion and bloodletting murder had been tortured—as indeed they had been—they were at pains to explain what Toaff had adduced, that those who had been tortured revealed the as-yet-unknown location of St. Simon's corpse. Had torture miraculously infused such knowledge? 

Too, the "blood libel" claimants pass off the confessions as a tell-me-what-you-want-me-to-say phenomenon, but, not only did the perpetrators reveal the location of St. Simon's mutilated little body, but Toaff documented that the perpetrators also revealed secret aspects of Judaic rituals that could not have been known to the torturers. 

Denials, bribery, rent garments, death threats, etc.—the modus operandi is repeated throughout history whether it is the ritual murder of Fr. Thomas in Damascus, the trial of Leo Frank for the murder of little Mary Fagan (the event that spawned the ADL), or the recent Israeli "Defense" Force's involvement with the rabbis' murder-for-organ-harvesting crime syndicate. 

While first editions of Toaff's Pasque di Sangue: Ebrei d'Europa e omicidi rituali (Bloody Passover: European Jews and Ritual Homicide) (Bologna, Italy: Il Mulino, 2007) have commanded a high price as soon as the publication was ceased, the original book is still available online (vho.org). 

An English translation is available (bloodpassover.com and israelshamir.net). 

Of course, the ADL's second edition is readily available to anyone who would want it. 

One thing that is interesting because it was "missing in action" from all the furor was Toaff's documentation of Judaic culture in the time of St. Simon of Trent. It is not just a ritual murder cult that Toaff documented, but a wicked culture pervaded by perversion and criminality, including prostitution, violent extortion, and murder-for-hire, especially by physician poisoners. Toaff freely stipulated such a hellish culture, but not a peep was ever mentioned about that in all the propaganda against him and his book. 

Excerpt from Chapter Eight, BLOOD PASSOVER, Ariel Toaff, Translated by Gian Marco Lucchese and Pietro Gianetti, 2007 

"That Christian Europe of the Middle Ages feared the Jews is an established fact. Perhaps the widespread fear that Jews were scheming to abduct children, subjecting them to cruel rituals, even antedates the appearance of stereotypical ritual murder which seems to have originated in the 12th century. As for myself, I believe that serious consideration should be given to the possibility that this fear was largely related to the slave trade, particularly in the 9th and 10th centuries, when the Jewish role in the slave trade appears to have been preponderant (10). 

"During this period, Jewish merchants, from the cities in the valley of the Rhône, Verdun, Lione, Arles and Narbonne, in addition to Aquisgrana, the capital of the empire in the times of Louis the Pious [Louis I]; and in Germany from the centres of the valley of the Rhine, from Worms, Magonza and Magdeburg; in Bavaria and Bohemia, from Regensburg and Prague—were active in the principal markets in which slaves (women, men, eunuchs) were offered for sale, by Jews, sometimes after abducting them from their houses. From Christian Europe the human merchandise was exported to the Islamic lands of Spain, in which there was a lively market. The castration of these slaves, particularly children, raised their prices, and was no doubt a lucrative and profitable practice (11).

"The first testimony relating to the abduction of children by Jewish merchants active in the trade flowing into Arab Spain, 

p. 129] 

"comes down to us in a letter from Agobard, archbishop of Lyon in the years 816-840. The French prelate describes the appearance at Lyons of a Christian slave, having escaped from Córdoba, who had been abducted from Leonese Jewish merchant twenty four years before, when he was a child, to be sold to the Moslems of Spain. His companion in flight was another Christian slave having suffered a similar fate after being abducted six years before by Jewish merchants at Arles. The inhabitants of Lyons confirmed these claims, adding that yet another Christian boy had been abducted by Jews to be sold into slavery that same year. Agobard concludes his report with a comment of a general nature; that these were not considered isolated cases, because, in every day practice, the Jews continued to procure Christian slaves for themselves and furthermore subjecting them to "infamies such that it would be vile in itself to describe them" (12). 

"Precisely what kind of abominable "infamies" Agobard is referring to is not clear; but it is possible that he was referring to castration more than to circumcision (13). Liutprando, bishop of Cremona, in his Antapodosis, said to have been written in approximately 958-962, referred to the city of Verdun as the principal market in which Jews castrated young slaves intended for sale to the Moslems of Spain (14). During this same period, two Arab sources, Ibn Haukal and Ibrahim al Qarawi, also stressed that the majority of their eunuchs originated from France and were sold to the Iberian peninsula by Jewish merchants. Other Arabic writers mentioned Lucerna, a city with a Jewish majority, halfway between Córdoba and Málaga in southern Spain, as another major market, in which the castration of Christian children after reducing them to slavery was practiced on a large scale by the very same people (15). 

"Contemporary rabbinical responses provide further confirmation of the role played by Jews in the trade in children and young people as well as in the profitable transformation of boys into eunuchs. These texts reveal that anyone who engaged in such trade was aware of the risks involved, because any person caught and arrested in possession of castrated slaves in Christian territories was decapitated by order of the local authorities (16). 

"Even the famous Natronai, Gaon of the rabbinical college of Sura in the mid-9th century was aware of the problems linked to the dangerous trade in young eunuchs. 

p. 130] 

"'Jewish (merchants) entered (into a port or a city), bringing with them slaves and castrated children [Hebrew: serisim ketannim]. When the local authorities confiscated them, the Jews corrupted them with money, reducing them to more harmless advisors, and the merchandise was returned, at least in part' (17). 

"But if one wishes to interpret the significance and scope of the Jewish presence in the slave trade and practice of castration, it is a fact that the fear that Christian children might be abducted and sold was rather widespread and deeply rooted in all Western European countries, particularly, France and Germany, from which these Jews originated and where the greater part of the slave merchants operated. Personalities in the clergy nourished that fear, conferring religious connotations upon it with an anti-Jewish slant, failing to account for the fact that slavery as a trade had not yet gone out of fashion morally and, as such, was broadly tolerated in the economic reality of the period. On the other hand, the abduction and castration of children, often inevitably confused with circumcision, which was no less feared and abhorred, could not fail to insinuate themselves in the collective unconscious mind of Christian Europe, especially the French and German territories, inciting anxiety and fear, which probably solidified over time, and, as a result, are believed to have concretized themselves in a variety of ways and in more or less in the same places, as ritual murder.

From Christian Europe the human merchandise was exported to the Islamic lands of Spain, in which there was a lively market. The castration of these slaves, particularly children, raised their prices, and was no doubt a lucrative and profitable practice" (Excerpt, Chapter Eight, PASQUE DI SANGUE, ENGLISH TRANSLATION – Gian Marco Lucchese and Pietro Gianetti, 2007, REVISION DATE SEPT. 14, 2007 ROSH HOSHANA, NIGHTFALL (5768). bloodpassover.com). 


"It has been clearly proven that the Jew Juce Franco did seduce some Christians [false converts from Judaism, "Marranos"] to the rites and ceremonies of the Law of Moses by teaching them Jewish prayers, praying in Hebrew to the Creator to whom he commended them, and telling them that the Law of Moses was the true law, whereas the Law of Christ was false. He also taught them the times of the Jewish Passover and other Fasts, and explained to them why the Jews did not eat certain meats. He further did communicate to and participate with these same Christians [Marranos] in other mysteries of his Jewish law, serving them Jewish foods and wine, eating and drinking with them the better to confirm them in the Law of Moses. . . . This Juce Franco personally took part, together with other Jews and with Christians [Marranos], in the crucifixion—at night and in a secret cave—of an innocent Christian boy. They stretched out his arms and legs on two boards arranged in the form of a Cross. Then they flogged him, spat on him, beat him, tore out the pieces of his flesh, and put a crown of thorns on his head. This Juce Franco, with his own hands seized the bleeding boy by the arm, cut open his side with a knife, and took out his heart. Then he beat him and tore his flesh in memory and vituperation of the Sacred Passion of Jesus Christ our Redeemer, uttering curses and insults on the Person of Christ as though He were actually on the Cross. And while they were flogging the said youth, they said to him: "This traitor and deceiver, when he preached, spoke lies against the Law of God and the Law of Moses." 

"Now you will pay for the things you said and did in that ancient time. You thought you would abase us and exalt yourself, for which you shall suffer even more evil than this. You thought you would destroy us, but we will destroy you. Crucify him. crucify him—this dog, this swindler, this deceiver, and bewitcher! He called himself King of the Jews. But he was a mere man, like any other, a bastard born in adultery, the son of a corrupt and adulterous woman. He tried to destroy the Jews and their Law, but it is he who will be destroyed by us, for coming to turn the Jews into Christians with his deceptions and witchcraft." These words and vituperations this Juce Franco and the other Jews first taught to these Christians [Marranos], who then imitated these Jews in the same manner, repeating the same vituperations and others of the same kind. And after the child had been tortured and crucified by this Juce Franco and the others, they killed him, took him down from the Cross, and took him away and secretly buried him that same night where no one could find him. Some days later this Jew, Juce Franco, and all his other accomplices in this crime, met together secretly in the same cave, where they performed certain conjuring and experiments in witchcraft with the heart of the dead boy and a consecrated Communion wafer. They performed these conjurings with the perverted and diabolical intention of making the Inquisitors against heretical depravity together with all other Christians go mad and die of madness, and of subverting, and destroying and killing the Holy Faith of Jesus."

"HOLOCAUST"

You don't think that the goal of the Holocaust Fundamentalists is to replace Jesus' Sacrifice on Calvary with "the Holocaust" as the pivot point of all history? 

"If Auschwitz is true, it represents human suffering that is incomparably greater than that of Christ. . . Auschwitz is the denial of Christ" (Claude Lanzmann, Les Temps Modernes, Paris, December 1993, p. 133). 

Holocaust fundamentalists even want to replace Jesus Christ the King at His Judgment Seat: "When each of us stands before the Six Million, we will be asked what we did with our lives" (Simon Wiesenthal's magazine Response, Vol. 20, No. 1). 

"The Holocaust is a divine mystery whose secrets are reserved for a priesthood of survivors" (Elie Wiesel quoted by Peter Novick in, The Holocaust in American Life, 1999, p. 211-212). 

Certainly Jews were among the 55 million who died in World War II, but important claims by Holocaust Fundamentalists are crumbling under deserved examination, even though such examination is—unlike any other historical issue—criminalized in over a dozen "democracies." In 1933 World Jewry declared War on a Germany suffering the same kind of Jewish economic warfare that we suffer today. Have you forgotten that on August 7, 1933 Samuel Untermeyer, as representative of the World Conference of Jews, declared war on Germany and then broadcast the declaration on WABC radio and published it in the New York Times? 

Google "Samuel Untermeyer text speech," pick your source. Judea Declares War on Germany (tinyurl.com, video.google.com, or amazon.com). 

"The fight against Germany has now been waged for months by every Jewish community, on every conference, in all labor unions and by every single Jew in the world. There are reasons for the assumption that our share in this fight is of general importance. We shall start a spiritual and material war of the whole world against Germany. Germany is striving to become once again a great nation, and to recover her lost territories as well as her colonies. But our Jewish interests call for the complete destruction of Germany . . . " Valadimir Jabotinsky (founder of the Jewish terrorist group, Irgun Zvai Leumi), in Mascha Rjetsch, January, 1934, (also quoted in Histoire de l'Armée Allemande by Jacques Benoist-Mechin, Vol. IV, p. 303) 

Have you forgotten the victims of Jewish-led-and-funded Communist revolutions of the early twentieth century in Bavaria, Hungary, Russia, and elsewhere? There was a holocaust of over 60 million at the hands of Judeo-Bolshevism revisionisthistory.org). For Germany then, Jews were a declared internal enemy. (See Dr. E. Michael Jones' new 1,200 page book The Jewish Revolutionary Spirit and Its Impact on World History, ISBN 9780929891071, available at culturewars.com). 

The pose as always sinless perpetual victims is a fraud. There is "cause" and there is "effect." Bad "cause" often begets bad "effect." 


DECLARING WAR HAS ITS CONSEQUENCES! WAGING WAR (& REVOLUTION) HAS ITS CONSEQUENCES!

See the videotaped interview of the Auschwitz director admitting that the "gas chamber" was fabricated AFTER the war by the Communists with a wooden door, a "homicidal gas chamber" that has NO safe means of introducing or removing cyanide, and has NO cyanide residue. The interview was conducted by David Cole, himself a Jew (holocaustdenialvideos.com). 

Numerous Holocaust Fundamentalist "scholars" have RECANTED THEIR CLAIMS: The Victories of Revisionism (aaargh.codoh.info in French, translate in Google. See also Germar Rudolf and Carlo Mattogno, Auschwitz Lies, available at: vho.org). 

The quality of "eyewitness" testimony is shameful. Watch ABC News video of "Holocaust eyewitness," Herman Rosenblat rationalizing his shameful deception:

Interviewer: How can you say it wasn't a lie? It wasn't true and you know it's not true. 
Rosenblat: Yes, it's not true, but in my imagination it was true (tinyurl.com and video.google.com). 

"The head Nazi-hunter's trail of lies" by Guy Walters, Times, London, UK, July 18, 2009 (timesonline.co.uk and tinyurl.com). 

Professor David O'Connell also published a well-documented study of Elie Wiesel's "eyewitness" lies. For his effort, the Holocaust Fundamentalists attempted to have him fired (culturewars.com). 

The Jews were claiming that "6 million" Jews were killed in World War ONE! ("The Crucifixion of the Jews Must Stop," The American Hebrew, October 31, 1919, p. 582.) You can see a photocopy of the original bogus claim at biblebelievers.org.au). 

The "6 million" number is a number that has magical numerology ("gematria") significance to occultic Judaism's Kabbalists: 

Esau/Edom, and the Trail of the Serpent. 

Deconstructing Six Million HoloMyths by Harrell Rhome (rense.com). 

The Sacred Nature of Six Million in the Judaic Religion: Why Six Million Holocaust Victims Cannot be Questioned by Michael Fishwick, 11th February 2009 (Our Lady of Lourdes) (z10.invisionfree.com). 

The Torah has a long tradition of lying victimhood. For example, note the typically ridiculous self-reports of victimhood in tractate Gittin of the Torah, the 4 billion (yes, billion) Jews killed by the Romans [Gittin 57b claims Vespasian killed "four hundred thousand myriads" = 400,000 x 10,000 = 4 BILLION] and the 64 million Jewish children skewered and burned in scrolls by the Romans in one city alone [Gittin 58a claims "400 synagogues" each with "400 teachers" and "400 pupils" for each teacher" = 400 x 400 x 400 = 64 million]. 

Even today the rabbis speak approvingly of Hitler's work as divine retribution. Revealingly the rabbis have been saying approving things about Hitler and his "holocaust" for half a century, Chabad Lubavitch Grand Rabbi (and erstwhile "Messiah") Schneerson among them [Yehuda Bauer, "God as surgeon." Haaretz, June 1, 2007] (haaretz.com and haaretz.com). 

Rabbi Elizer Schach, founder of the "Israeli" Shas Party: "Does anyone here think that before the holocaust, which exacted such a terrible price and left no family untouched, all the Jews of Europe were righteous, God-fearing folk? There was a drift away from our faith and way of life. What happened was divine retribution for the accumulated weight of years of drifting away from Judaism" (Mordecai Richter, National Post (Canada), August 26, 2000). 

"Israeli" Rabbi Ovadia Yosef stated that those who died in the Nazi persecutions were "reincarnated sinners" who got what they deserved, that Hitler "was simply the messenger of God sent to give the Jewish people their just desserts" (Jack Katzenell, "Rabbi Says Holocaust Victims Were Reincarnations of Sinners." The Independent (UK), August 6, 2000. independent.co.uk).

Yes, the rabbis were—and still are—most happy that Nazi persecution served their purposes, the advancement of Zionism and consolidation of rabbinic power and prestige. All forms of genuine antisemitism (not to be confused with the ADL/Abe Foxman variety of "anything—we-don't-like-is-antisemitism") have served the purposes of the rabbis. Where antisemitism has not existed, Judaics have had to fabricate, fund, and foster it. Much, but not all, synagogue and grave vandalism has been perpetrated by Judaics themselves. 

Among many: Michael Kallenbach, "Stasi Files Reveal Links to Anti-Semitic Attacks in Former West Germany." Jewish Chronicle (UK), March 12, 1993. ". . . 10 out of 14 [neo-Nazi] party members. . . were exposed as being in the pay of regional state intelligence services" (Sunday Telegraph (UK), March 12, 2003). 

"In the 1960s the leader of the Canadian Nazi Party was John Beattie. '[E]verything from his group's name to its major activities was suggested or quarterbacked by persons acting as agents for, or reporting to the Canadian Jewish Congress. . . The Canadian Jewish Congress, which largely created the short-lived Canadian Nazi Party, had, since the 1930s been lobbying for restrictions on freedom of speech. . . an agent for the Canadian Jewish Congress proposed [to Beattie] legal maneuvers that were calculated to frighten and cause distress among Jews, thus heightening the 'Nazi' menace, which was used as the argument for the 1971 'hate law' (Section 319 of the Canadian Criminal Code. . ." Testimony of Paul Fromm, Canadian Association of Free Expression, press release, Nov. 26, 2000; Patrick Walsh, "The John Beattie Case," in "The Unholy Alliance: A Documented Case of How Agents Provocateur Infiltrate and Misdirect" (Canadian Intelligence Publications, 1986. p. 13). 

"In the 1990s, Grant Bristow, an associate of the Canadian Jewish Congress and an agent of Canada's secret service, the CSIS (Canadian Security Intelligence Service), took a leadership role in the Right-wing German-Canadian advocacy group, the "Heritage Front," including supplying them with money. 'Bristow frequently advocated violence against Jews. . . Bristow compiled a target list of prominent Jews. He was far more than a mere informant or spy. He was a player, a strong advocate of violence and lawlessness and an anti-Jewish agitator.' Heritage Front members eventually succumbed to Bristow's agitation, going to a tavern known to be a hangout for Marxists and Zionists. A fight ensued and Heritage Front members were arrested. The group eventually disbanded, but not before generating plenty of 'Jew hater' publicity in the media, very useful to Zionist and rabbinic interests" (Paul Fromm, "CSIS Spy Bristow Speaks to Canadian Jewish Congress," August 4, 2003, in Michael Hoffman, Judaism Discovered: A Study of the Anti-Biblical Religion of Racism, Self-Worship, Superstition, and Deceit, ISBN9780970378453, p. 833).

More in Canada: "Neo-Nazi hate, courtesy of the CHRC [Canadian Human Rights Commission]" by Ezra Levant, National Post (Canada), July 15, 2009 (ezralevant.com). 

The lesson is clear. Genuine antisemitism serves the rabbis' purposes. Catholics are called to emulate Jesus, not Hitler or the Canadian Jewish Congress or the Judaics and Judaic organizations named by Brenner as colluding with Hitler for the destruction of their own people.

The number of Israelis killed by Palestinian armed groups diminished by half. More than 650 Palestinians, including some 120 children, and 27 Israelis were killed. Israeli forces carried out air and artillery bombardments in the Gaza Strip, and Israel continued to expand illegal settlements and to build a 700-km fence/wall on Palestinian land in the Occupied Territories. Military blockades and increased restrictions imposed by Israel on the movement of Palestinians and the confiscation by Israel of Palestinian customs duties caused a significant deterioration in living conditions for Palestinian inhabitants in the Occupied Territories, with poverty, food aid dependency, health problems and unemployment reaching crisis levels. Israeli soldiers and settlers committed serious human rights abuses, including unlawful killings, against Palestinians, mostly with impunity. Thousands of Palestinians were arrested by Israeli forces throughout the Occupied Territories on suspicion of security offences and hundreds were held in administrative detention. Israeli conscientious objectors continued to be imprisoned for refusing to serve in the army. In a 34-day war against Hizbullah in Lebanon in July-August, Israeli forces committed serious violations of international humanitarian law, including war crimes.

HORROR QUOTES 

"The indwelling Glory [of god] embraces all worlds, all creatures, good and evil. And it is the true Unity. How then, you ask, can it bear in itself the opposites of good and evil? But in truth there is no opposite, for Evil is the throne of Good" (Martin Buber, Hasidism and Modern Man, p. 200). 

[Isaiah] thereupon pronounced [the Divine] Name and was swallowed up by a cedar. The cedar, however, was brought and sawn asunder. When the saw reached his mouth he died. [And this was his penalty] for having said, 'And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips' (Babylonian Talmud, Yebamoth 49b, Soncino Edition). 

. . . the Holocaust and our contemporary evolutionary consciousness force upon us a major reformulation of our understanding of divine and human agency. In speaking of the need to rediscover a compelling God as the ground of post-Holocaust ethics, I believe I am close to the stage Elie Wiesel has reached as he has probed the depth of the Holocaust these many years . . . Weisel hints that after all is said and done, the Holocaust may reveal that divine and human liberation are very much intertwined, and that, despite continuing tension, both God and humanity yearn for each other as a result. In consequence of this linkage, Weisel is prepared to say that human acts of justice and compassion help to liberate God, to restore the divine image as Fackenheim has put it . . . (Fr. John Pawlikowski, "Thinking About God After Auschwitz," Good and Evil After Auschwitz, p. 62-63, books.google.com). 


AGAINST USURY 

God bound the Church against usury, as originally prohibited by Mosaic Law in the Old Testament: 

"If thou lend money to any of My people that is poor, that dwelleth with thee, thou shalt not be hard upon them as an extortioner, nor oppress them with usuries" (Exodus 22:25). 

'If thy brother be impoverished, and weak of hand, and thou receive him as a stranger and sojourner, and he live with thee, Take not usury of him nor more than thou gavest: fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee. Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor exact of him any increase of fruits" (Leviticus 25:35-37). 

"Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury, nor corn, nor any other thing: But to the stranger. To thy brother thou shalt lend that which he wanteth, without usury: that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all thy works in the land, which thou shalt go in to possess" (Deuteronomy 23:19-20. See also Psalms 14:1-5 and Ezekiel 18:3-13). 

Jesus, True God and True Man, Who can neither deceive nor be deceived, exhorts against the injustice of usury, extending the New Covenant's balm of justice and mercy to all mankind: 

"And if you love them that love you, what thanks are to you? for sinners also love those that love them. And if you do good to them who do good to you, what thanks are to you? for sinners also do this. And if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive, what thanks are to you? for sinners also lend to sinners, for to receive as much. But love ye your enemies: do good, and lend, hoping for nothing thereby: and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the sons of the Highest; for he is kind to the unthankful, and to the evil. Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful" (Luke 6:32-36). 

Numerous papal and conciliar canons, decrees, and encyclicals have affirmed the perennial condemnation of usury. An exemplary conciliar canon: 

Moreover the detestable and shameful and, I say, insatiable rapacity of money lenders, forbidden both by divine and human laws throughout the Scripture in the Old and in the New Testament, we condemn, and we separate them from all ecclesiastical consolation, demanding that no archbishop, no bishop, no abbot of any rank, nor anyone in an order and in the clergy presume to receive moneylenders except with the greatest caution. But during their whole life let them be considered disreputable and, unless they repent, let them be deprived of Christian burial (Second Lateran Council (1139 A.D) §13). 

The Knights Templar are arguably among the earliest moneylenders who claimed to be Catholic, yet they were abolished, not only for their moneylending, by a conciliar edict including this canon: 

If anyone shall fall into that error, so that he obstinately presumes to declare that it is not a sin to exercise usury, we decree that he must be punished as a heretic (Ex gravi ad nos, Council of Vienne (1311-1312AD). 

While the Magisterium has certainly damned communism, those of you who idolize capitalism and promote usury should be very careful that you do not find yourselves among the goats on Judgment Day. 


THE HEBREW BIBLE ON THE ISRAELITES—COVENANT AND JUDGMENT

In Deuteronomy 28 and Leviticus 26 God specified the contract of the Mosaic Covenant. He specified the duties of the Israelites to obey Him, the rewards if they obeyed Him, and the penalties if they disobeyed Him. See also: Leviticus 18:28; Numbers 14:23; Deuteronomy 4:26-27; 6:18; 7:12; Deuteronomy 30; Ezekiel 13:9; Jeremiah 7:15; 29:13-14. 

God did not promise to reward disobedience with power, admiration, or a real estate deal in the Middle East; He promised dispersal and misery, even to vomit them out. 

"Keep ye My ordinances and My judgments, and do not any of these abominations: neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you. For all these detestable things the inhabitants of the land have done, that; were before you, and have defiled it. Beware then, lest in like manner, it vomit you also out, if you do the like things, as it vomited out the nation that was before you. Every soul that shall commit any of these abominations, shall perish from the midst of his people. Keep My commandments. Do not the things which they have done, that have been before you, and be not defiled therein. I am the Lord your God" (Leviticus 18:26-30). 

Here is God's Judgment about how well the Israelites obeyed: 

I Samuel 8:7-8 "And the Lord said to Samuel: Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee. For they have not rejected thee, but Me, that I should not reign over them. According to all their works, they have done from the day that I brought them out of Egypt until this day: as they have forsaken Me, and served strange gods, so do they also unto thee". 

I Samuel 13:13 "And Samuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly, and hast not kept the commandments of the Lord thy God, which He commanded thee. And if thou hadst not done thus, the Lord would now have established thy kingdom over Israel forever". 

I Samuel 18:18 "And [Elijah] said [to king Ahab]: I have not troubled Israel, but thou and thy father's house, who have forsaken the commandments of the Lord, and have followed Baalim". 

I Samuel 19:10 ". . . for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy covenant: they have thrown down Thy altars, they have slain Thy prophets with the sword". 

Isaiah 65:11-12 "and you, that have forsaken the Lord, that have forgotten My holy mountain, that set a table for fortune, and offer libations upon it, I will number you in the sword, and you shall all fall by slaughter: because I called and you did not answer: I spoke and you did not hear: and you did evil in My eyes, and you have chosen the things that displease Me. Therefore thus saith the Lord God: behold My servants shall eat, and you shall be hungry: behold My servants shall drink, and you shall be thirsty. Behold My servants shall rejoice and you shall be confounded: behold My servants shall praise for joyfulness of heart, and you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for grief of spirit. And you shall leave your name for an execration to My elect: and the Lord God shall slay thee, and call His servants by another name". 

Ezekiel 8:18 ". . . therefore I will also deal with them in My wrath: My eyes shall not spare them, neither will he show mercy: and when they shall cry to My ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them". 

Jeremiah 2:13 "For my people have done two evils. They have forsaken Me, the fountain of living water, and have digged to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water". 

Ezekiel 20:23-25 "Again I lifted up My hand upon them in the wilderness, to disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries: because they had not done My judgments, and had cast off My statutes, and had violated My sabbaths, and their eyes had been after the idols of their fathers. Therefore I also gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments, in which they shall not live". 

Ezekiel 36:16-20 "And the Word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it with their ways, and with their doings: their way was before Me like the uncleanness of a menstruous woman. And I poured out My indignation upon them for the blood which they had shed upon the land, and with their idols they defiled it. And I scattered them among the nations, and they are dispersed through the countries: I have judged them according to their ways, and their devices. And when they entered among the nations whither they went, they profaned My holy Name, when it was said of them: This is the people of the Lord, and they are come forth out of His land". 

Jeremiah 8:7-10 "The kite in the air hath known her time: the turtle, and the swallow, and the stork have observed the time of their coming: but my people have not known the judgment of the Lord. How do you say: We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Indeed the lying pen of the scribes hath wrought falsehood. The wise men are confounded, they are dismayed, and taken: for they have cast away the word of the Lord, and there is no wisdom in them. Therefore I will give their women to strangers, their fields to others for an inheritance: because from the least even to the greatest all follow covetousness: from the prophet even to the priest, all deal deceitfully".

Jeremiah 11:9, 13-14 "And the Lord said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem . . . For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto Me for their trouble". 

Jeremiah 44:23 "Because you have sacrificed to idols, and have sinned against the Lord: and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, and have not walked in His law, and in His commandments, and in His testimonies: therefore are these evils come upon you, as at this day". 

Daniel 9:25-27 "Know thou therefore, and take notice: that from the going forth of the Word, to build up Jerusalem again, unto Christ the prince, there shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks: and the street shall be built again, and the walls in straitness of times. And after sixty-two weeks Christ shall be slain: and the people that shall deny him shall not be his. And a people with their leader that shall come, shall destroy the city and the sanctuary: and the end thereof shall be waste, and after the end of the war the appointed desolation. And he shall confirm the Covenant with many, in one week: and in the half of the week the victim and the sacrifice shall fall: and there shall be in the temple the abomination of desolation: and the desolation shall continue even to the consummation, and to the end". 

Hosea 4:1-2 "Hear the Word of the Lord, ye children of Israel, for the Lord shall enter into judgment with the inhabitants of the land: for there is no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land. Cursing, and lying, and killing, and theft, and adultery have overflowed, and blood hath touched blood". 

Hosea 5:1-2 "Hear ye this, O priests, and hearken, O ye house of Israel, and give ear, O house of the king: for there is a judgment against you, because you have been a snare to them whom you should have watched over, and a net spread upon Thabor. And you have turned aside victims into the depth: and I am, the teacher of them all". 

Hosea 11:2 "they offered victims to Baalim, and sacrificed to idols". 

Amos 5:20-24 "I hate, and have rejected your festivities: and I will not receive the odour of your assemblies. And if you offer Me holocausts, and your gifts, I will not receive them: neither will I regard the vows of your fat beasts. Take away from Me the tumult of thy songs: and I will not hear the canticles of thy harp. But judgment shall be revealed as water, and justice as a mighty torrent". 

Amos 8:2 "And He said: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A hook to draw down fruit. And the Lord said to me: The end is come upon My people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more". 

Amos 9:1 "I saw the Lord standing upon the altar, and He said: Strike the hinges, and let the lintels be shook: for there is covetousness in the head of them all, and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall be no flight for them: they shall flee, and he that shall flee of them shall not be delivered". 

Malachi 2:8-12 "But you have departed out of the way, and have caused many to stumble at the law: you have made void the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. Therefore have I also made you contemptible, and base before all people, as you have not kept My ways, and have accepted persons in the law. Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why then doth every one of us despise his brother, violating the covenant of our fathers? Judah hath transgressed, and abomination hath been committed in Israel, and in Jerusalem: for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the Lord, which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange God. The Lord will cut off the man that hath done this, both the master, and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering to the Lord of hosts". 

Psalms 68:22-29 "And they gave Me gall for My food, and in My thirst they gave Me vinegar to drink. Let their table become as a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumbling block. Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend thou down always. Pour out Thy indignation upon them: and let Thy wrathful anger take hold of them. Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles. Because they have persecuted Him whom Thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of My wounds. Add Thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into Thy justice. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written". 

"One would think that Klinghoffer would mention, for example, the horrendous sins the Israelites committed at the very time they were receiving the Mosaic covenant from God. The story is told in graphic detail in Exodus 32-33. While Moses is up in the mountain to receive the Covenant from God, the Jews decide to create a false god made of gold. God is so angry at the Israelites, He wants to destroy the whole nation right then and there (which, according to Numers 1:32, is about two million people). If not for Moses' pleading with God, Israel would have breathed its last breath at Sinai. In fact, God was so angry that when Moses later asks God to go with them through the desert to Canaan, God refuses, citing the fact that if He goes he might destroy the Israelites! It isn't until Moses pleads once more that God decides to go, but only because he favors Moses, not the Israelites at large (Exodus 33:1-11). 

After this incident, things were never quite the same between God and Israel. For the next forty years God made them wander aimlessly, literally having them travel in circles in the Sinai desert. While they were wandering, one might think the Israelites would be in a state of remorse and repentance after having almost lost their lives at Sinai. But that was not the case. Time after time the Israelites continued to disobey the Covenant and incite the wrath of God. From the complaining against the manna (Numbers 11), to the murmuring of Aaron and Miriam (Numbers 12), to the rejection of Canaan and desire for Egypt (Numbers 13-14); to the rebellion of Nadab and Abihu (Exodus 10); to Korah's rebellion (Numbers 16); to the sexual lust at Peor (Numbers 25), the sins never stopped. So numerous and persistent are the sins that Moses makes a dire prediction in Deuteronomy 31:14-21 just prior to Canaan, stating that, based on its past history, Israel will continue to break the Covenant and bring down God's wrath. And that they did. In the time of the Judges, for 75% of the four centuries (1400-1000BC), God put the Jews under oppression from foreign rulers as punishment for their continual sins. In the time of the Kings, in a span of four more centuries (1000-600BC), almost every one of the kings earned the same obituary: "and he did evil in the sight of the Lord, and followed the sins of his father, with which he made Israel to sin, and so the anger of the Lord was kindled against them." 

Of the northern tribe's twenty kings, all twenty were said to be evil. Of the southern tribe's twenty kings, only three were good. Hence, of forty kings in four centuries, only 7.5% had not broken the Covenant. The Mosaic law was not even a part of their lives for centuries, having only been discovered by Hilkiah (II Chronicles 34:14) in the reign of Josiah (641-609BC). Of the people themselves, the percentage of Covenant breakers was even worse. Out of a nation of at least 5 million people in the ninth century BC, Elijah could only find 7,000 who have not bowed the knee to a false god (I Kings 19:18), an astounding statistic of only 0.14% of the people. The northern tribes were transported to Assyria for their punishment, never to be heard from again; and the two southern tribes were exiled to Babylon. When they returned from captivity under Ezra and Nehemiah, things didn't improve much at all. By the time of the Maccabees and on to the formation of sects such as the Pharisees and Sadducees, the Jews are quibbling about the minutia of the Law but still haven't learned to obey its precepts. It was after this, the culmination of 1,500 years of sin and rebellion, that even God, the epitome of longsuffering patience, could not put up with Israel any longer. It was God in Exodus 32:9 who had resolved even then in Jewish history: "I have seen this people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked people." Lo and behold, it was the same thing that Stephen saw 1,500 years later when he told the Jews in Jerusalem of their continual breaking of the Covenant (Acts 7:51-53): 

"You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it". 

"All one need do to confirm Stephen's story is read the prophets. Just the Book of Jeremiah will do, for it is where we derive the term "jeremiad." Page after page is filled with nothing but heart-wrenching words right from the mouth of God who is in utter consternation and sadness over the pernicious rebellion and disgusting immorality of the Jews. In Ezekiel and Hosea, Israel is called nothing short of a whore who can't keep her legs shut for any passer-by who whistles at her (Ezekiel 16; 23; Hosea 1-2). But you will find none of this in Klinghoffer's book. There is hardly a hint that the Israelites of bygone days had sinned grievously, much less sinned to the extent that God was forced to annul the Covenant that Klinghoffer finds so crucial to Jewish identity and survival today" (Robert Sungenis PhD, A Review of David Klinghoffer's: "Why the Jews Rejected Jesus" catholicintl.com). 


"I WILL BLESS THEM THAT BLESS THEE, AND CURSE THEM THAT CURSE THEE . . . " 

"I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, and in thee shall all the kindred of the earth be blessed" (Genesis 12:3). 

God made this Covenant with Abram when he was a Gentile. Notwithstanding errant exegesis by denominational Christians and Zionists, God was not speaking to or about Jewish people because there was Israelite nation, and there has never been a "Jewish" nation. Abram, not yet Abraham, was still a Gentile and God was speaking to Abram alone. 

In Galatians 3:6-8 Paul affirms that God's Covenant with Abram, later Abraham, was made to him as a Gentile: 

"As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness. Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham. And the Scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed." 

Paul further elaborates on the justification of and Covenant with Abraham who was never an Israelite or a Jew in Romans chapter 4. 


ABRAHAMIC COVENANT WITH EVERY ELECT IN ADAM'S RACE IS IRREVOCABLE

Genesis 17:7 "And I will establish My covenant between Me and thee, and between thy seed after thee in their generations, by a perpetual covenant: to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee". 

Hebrews 6:13-18 "For God making promise to Abraham, because He had no one greater by whom He might swear, swore by Himself, Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee, and multiplying I shall multiply thee. And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise. For men swear by one greater than themselves: and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their controversy. Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of His counsel, interposed an oath: That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest comfort, who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us". 


MOSAIC COVENANT IS REVOKED 

Through His Prophet Jeremiah, God warned that He would replace the Mosaic covenant: 

"Behold the days shall come, saith the Lord, and I will make a new Covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: not according to the Covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt: the Covenant which they made void, and I had dominion over them, saith the Lord". 

II Corinthians 3:6-15 "Who also hath made us fit ministers of the New Testament, not in the letter, but in the Spirit. For the letter killeth, but the Spirit quickeneth. Now if the ministration of death, engraven with letters upon stones, was glorious; so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance, which glory was to be done away: how shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious? For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth. For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious. Having therefore such hope, we use much confidence: and not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look on the face of that which is abolished. But their senses were made dull. For, until this present day, the selfsame veil remaineth untaken away in the reading of the Old Testament; which vail is done away in Christ. But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart". 

Colossians 2:14-15 "Blotting out the handwriting of the decree that was against us, which was contrary to us. He hath taken the same out of the way, fastening it to the cross: and despoiling the principalities and powers, He hath exposed them confidently in open show, triumphing over them in Himself". 

Ephesians 2:15 "Making void the Law of commandments contained in decrees; that he might make the two in himself into one new man, making peace". 

Hebrews 7:18 "There is indeed a setting aside of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof". 

Hebrews 8:1-13 Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens, A minister of the holies, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man. For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that He also should have some thing to offer. If then He were on earth, He would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the Law, Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith He) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount. But now He hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also He is a mediator of a better Testament, which is established on better promises. For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second. For finding fault with them, he saith: Behold, the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect unto the house of Israel, and unto the house of Judah, a New Testament: not according to the Testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in My Testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. For this is the Testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give My laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them: and I will be their God, and they shall be My people: And they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know Me from the least to the greatest of them: because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more. Now in saying a New, he hath made the former Old. And that which decayeth and groweth Old, is near its end". 

Hebrews 10:9 "Then said I: Behold, I come to do Thy will, O God: He taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth". 


PHARISEES

"The Pharisees are important for two reasons. First, the Gospels portray them as one of the principle opposition groups to Jesus. Second, Judaism as we know it generally traces its roots back to the Pharisees" (Jacob Neusner, Judaism in the Beginning of Christianity (Philadelphia: Fortress Press 1984), p.45).

"Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust. For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe Me also; for he wrote of Me. But if you do not believe His writings, how will you believe My words"? (John 5:45-47). 

"Who said to them: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees . . . . Why do you not understand that it was not concerning the bread I said to you: Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees? Then they understood that He said not that they should beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees" (Matthew 16:6-12). 

"And He charged them, saying: Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod" (Mark 8:15). 

"And when great multitudes stood about Him, so that they trod one upon another, He began to say to His disciples: Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy" (Luke 12:1). 

"He that believeth in Him is not judged. But he that doth not believe, is already judged: because he believeth not in the Name of the only begotten Son of God" (John 3:18). 

". . . the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation yielding the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it shall grind him to powder. And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard His parables, they knew that He spoke of them" (Matthew 21:43-45). 

"Hear ye another parable. There was a man an householder, who planted a vineyard, and made a hedge round about it, and dug in it a press, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen; and went into a strange country. And when the time of the fruits drew nigh, he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits thereof. And the husbandmen laying hands on his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent other servants more than the former; and they did to them in like manner. And last of all he sent to them his son, saying: They will reverence my son. But the husbandmen seeing the son, said among themselves: This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and we shall have his inheritance. And taking him, they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him. When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do to those husbandmen"? (Mathew 21:33-39). 


NOTE TWO KEY ELEMENTS OF THE ABOVE PARABLE:

1. the murderers KNEW he was the SON—"This is the heir." 
2. they plotted to kill Him "to have his inheritance."

Think about that. What will He do to those husbandmen? 


ANTISEMITISM

"The Jew is the living testimony of the disappearance of the State based on theological principles [i.e. Christendom], that State which the Anti-Semites hope to restore. From the day a Jew first occupied a public office, the Christian State was in danger. That is perfectly accurate and the Anti-Semites who say that the Jews have destroyed the correct idea of the State could more justly assert that the entrance of Jews into Christian Society has symbolized the destruction of the State, I mean, of course, the Christian State"  (Bernard Lazare, L'Antisemititisme, p. 361).

"Satan wants us to forget that there is One True Religion, the Supernatural Religion established by Our Lord Jesus Christ, True God and True Man. He wants us also to lose sight of the fact that there are Organized Forces working for the Advent of the Natural Messiah" (Rev. Denis Fahey, The Kingship of Christ and Organized Naturalism, p. 7-10). 

"It's a trick [calling people "anti-Semitic"], we always use it" (youtube.com). 

"As far as my experience goes they are also no better than other human groups, although they are protected from the worst cancers by a lack of power. Otherwise I cannot see anything 'chosen' about them" Albert Einstein on the Jews, Written in 1954 to the philosopher Eric Gutkind, recently sold for $404,000 at an auction in London (New York Times, May 17, 2008, Dennis Overbye, nytimes.com). 

"Anti-Semitism is nothing but the antagonistic attitude produced in the non-Jew by the Jewish group. The Jewish group has thrived on oppression and on the antagonism it has forever met in the world" (Albert Einstein, Collier's Magazine, November 26, 1938). 

"Nowadays if any States raise a protest against us it is only pro forma at our discretion, and by our direction, for their anti-Semitism is indispensable to us for the management of our lesser brethren. I will not enter into further explanations, for this matter has formed the subject of repeated discussions amongst us" (Protocol IX:2). 

"Deep down, I believe that a little anti-Semitism is a good thing for the Jews—reminds us who we are" (Jay Lefkowitz (Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy) NYT Magazine. Feb.12, 1995, p. 65). 

"All critics of Jews should not be tagged as anti-Semites . . . that the Nazis are brutes does not make us angels. . . Criticism is not the same as hatred, and critics are not our enemies. The greatest friends of a people are not those who praise but those who honestly find fault. A people without criticism is either a dictatorship or a community so deeply embedded in smug selfsatisfaction as to be on the road to decadence" (William Zuckerman, Goldstein, D., p. 119). 

"The far-reaching consequences of the [Jewish] martyr complex go beyond any effect of the individual Jew... and do not leave unmarked even the most sympathetically inclined Gentiles. Since the Jew is hypersensitive on the subject of his Judaism, Gentiles fear to offer constructive criticism lest they be accused of prejudices. Thus the Jew is denied the benefit of honest evaluation of the very real differences and prejudices existing... I believe we Jews will never be normal individuals so long as we foster our martyr complex, so long as we remain evasive of self-appraisal and self-improvement, and so long as it is easier to blame the other fellow for our own faults" (Maurice M. Feurlich, Children of the Martyr Race, The Forum, NYC, September 1937). judaism.htm
